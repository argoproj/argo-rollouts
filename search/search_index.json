Argo Rollouts (optionally) integrates with ingress controllers and service meshes, leveraging their traffic shaping abilities to gradually shift traffic to the new version during an update. Additionally, Rollouts can query and interpret metrics from various providers to verify key KPIs and drive automated promotion or rollback during an update. Here is a demonstration video (click to watch on Youtube): Why Argo Rollouts? \u00b6 The native Kubernetes Deployment Object supports the RollingUpdate strategy which provides a basic set of safety guarantees (readiness probes) during an update. However the rolling update strategy faces many limitations: Few controls over the speed of the rollout Inability to control traffic flow to the new version Readiness probes are unsuitable for deeper, stress, or one-time checks No ability to query external metrics to verify an update Can halt the progression, but unable to automatically abort and rollback the update For these reasons, in large scale high-volume production environments, a rolling update is often considered too risky of an update procedure since it provides no control over the blast radius, may rollout too aggressively, and provides no automated rollback upon failures. Controller Features \u00b6 Blue-Green update strategy Canary update strategy Fine-grained, weighted traffic shifting Automated rollbacks and promotions Manual judgement Customizable metric queries and analysis of business KPIs Ingress controller integration: NGINX, ALB Service Mesh integration: Istio, Linkerd, SMI Metric provider integration: Prometheus, Wavefront, Kayenta, Web, Kubernetes Jobs, Datadog, New Relic, Graphite Quick Start \u00b6 kubectl create namespace argo-rollouts kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml Follow the full getting started guide to walk through creating and then updating a rollout object. How does it work? \u00b6 Similar to the deployment object , the Argo Rollouts controller will manage the creation, scaling, and deletion of ReplicaSets . These ReplicaSets are defined by the spec.template field inside the Rollout resource, which uses the same pod template as the deployment object. When the spec.template is changed, that signals to the Argo Rollouts controller that a new ReplicaSet will be introduced. The controller will use the strategy set within the spec.strategy field in order to determine how the rollout will progress from the old ReplicaSet to the new ReplicaSet. Once that new ReplicaSet is scaled up (and optionally passes an Analysis ), the controller will mark it as \"stable\". If another change occurs in the spec.template during a transition from a stable ReplicaSet to a new ReplicaSet (i.e. you change the application version in the middle of a rollout), then the previously new ReplicaSet will be scaled down, and the controller will try to progress the ReplicasSet that reflects the updated spec.template field. There is more information on the behaviors of each strategy in the spec section. Use cases of Argo Rollouts \u00b6 A user wants to run last-minute functional tests on the new version before it starts to serve production traffic. With the BlueGreen strategy, Argo Rollouts allows users to specify a preview service and an active service. The Rollout will configure the preview service to send traffic to the new version while the active service continues to receive production traffic. Once a user is satisfied, they can promote the preview service to be the new active service. ( example ) Before a new version starts receiving live traffic, a generic set of steps need to be executed beforehand. With the BlueGreen Strategy, the user can bring up the new version without it receiving traffic from the active service. Once those steps finish executing, the rollout can cut over traffic to the new version. A user wants to give a small percentage of the production traffic to a new version of their application for a couple of hours. Afterward, they want to scale down the new version and look at some metrics to determine if the new version is performant compared to the old version. Then they will decide if they want to roll out the new version for all of the production traffic or stick with the current version. With the canary strategy, the rollout can scale up a ReplicaSet with the new version to receive a specified percentage of traffic, wait for a specified amount of time, set the percentage back to 0, and then wait to rollout out to service all of the traffic once the user is satisfied. ( example ) A user wants to slowly give the new version more production traffic. They start by giving it a small percentage of the live traffic and wait a while before giving the new version more traffic. Eventually, the new version will receive all the production traffic. With the canary strategy, the user specifies the percentages they want the new version to receive and the amount of time to wait between percentages. ( example ) A user wants to use the normal Rolling Update strategy from the deployment. If a user uses the canary strategy with no steps, the rollout will use the max surge and max unavailable values to roll to the new version.

Even though it works great with Argo CD and other Argo projects, it can be used on its own for Progressive Delivery scenarios. More specifically, argo Rollouts does NOT require that you also have installed Argo CD on the same cluster. How does Argo Rollouts integrate with Argo CD? \u00b6 Argo CD understands the health of Argo Rollouts resources via Argo CD\u2019s Lua health check . These Health checks understand when the Argo Rollout objects are Progressing, Suspended, Degraded, or Healthy. Additionally, Argo CD has Lua based Resource Actions that can mutate an Argo Rollouts resource (i.e. unpause a Rollout). As a result, an operator can build automation to react to the states of the Argo Rollouts resources. For example, if a Rollout created by Argo CD is paused, Argo CD detects that and marks the Application as suspended. Once the new version is verified to be good, the operator can use Argo CD\u2019s resume resource action to unpause the Rollout so it can continue to make progress. Can we run the Argo Rollouts kubectl plugin commands via Argo CD? \u00b6 Argo CD supports running Lua scripts to modify resource kinds (i.e. suspending a CronJob by setting the .spec.suspend to true). These Lua Scripts can be configured in the argocd-cm ConfigMap or upstreamed to the Argo CD's resource_customizations directory. These custom actions have two Lua scripts: one to modify the said resource and another to detect if the action can be executed (i.e. A user should not be able to resuming a unpaused Rollout). Argo CD allows users to execute these actions via the UI or CLI. In the CLI, a user (or a CI system) can run argocd app actions run <APP_NAME> <ACTION> This command executes the action listed on the application listed. In the UI, a user can click the hamburger button of a resource and the available actions will appear in a couple of seconds. The user can click and confirm that action to execute it. Currently, the Rollout action has two available custom actions in Argo CD: resume and restart. Resume unpauses a Rollout with a PauseCondition Restart: Sets the RestartAt and causes all the pods to be restarted. Does Argo Rollout require a Service Mesh like Istio? \u00b6 Argo Rollouts does not require a service mesh or ingress controller to be used. In the absence of a traffic routing provider, Argo Rollouts manages the replica counts of the canary/stable ReplicaSets to achieve the desired canary weights. Normal Kubernetes Service routing (via kube-proxy) is used to split traffic between the ReplicaSets. Does Argo Rollout require we follow GitOps in my organization? \u00b6 Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller that will react to any manifest change regardless of how the manifest was changed. The manifest can be changed by a Git commit, an API call, another controller or even a manual kubectl command. You can use Argo Rollouts with any traditional CI/CD solution that does not follow the GitOps approach. Can we run the Argo Rollouts controller in HA mode? \u00b6 Yes. A k8s cluster can run multiple replicas of Argo-rollouts controllers to achieve HA. To enable this feature, run the controller with --leader-elect flag and increase the number of replicas in the controller's deployment manifest. The implementation is based on the k8s client-go's leaderelection package . This implementation is tolerant to arbitrary clock skew among replicas. The level of tolerance to skew rate can be configured by setting --leader-election-lease-duration and --leader-election-renew-deadline appropriately. Please refer to the package documentation for details. Rollouts \u00b6 Which deployment strategies does Argo Rollouts support? \u00b6 Argo Rollouts supports BlueGreen, Canary, and Rolling Update. Additionally, Progressive Delivery features can be enabled on top of the blue-green/canary update, which further provides advanced deployment such as automated analysis and rollback. Does the Rollout object follow the provided strategy when it is first created? \u00b6 As with Deployments, Rollouts does not follow the strategy parameters on the initial deploy. The controller tries to get the Rollout into a steady state as fast as possible. The controller tries to get the Rollout into a steady state as fast as possible by creating a fully scaled up ReplicaSet from the provided .spec.template . Once the Rollout has a stable ReplicaSet to transition from, the controller starts using the provided strategy to transition the previous ReplicaSet to the desired ReplicaSet. How does BlueGreen rollback work? \u00b6 A BlueGreen Rollout keeps the old ReplicaSet up and running for 30 seconds or the value of the scaleDownDelaySeconds. The controller tracks the remaining time before scaling down by adding an annotation called argo-rollouts.argoproj.io/scale-down-deadline to the old ReplicaSet. If the user applies the old Rollout manifest before the old ReplicaSet scales down, the controller does something called a fast rollback. The controller immediately switches the active service\u2019s selector back to the old ReplicaSet\u2019s rollout-pod-template-hash and removes the scaled down annotation from that ReplicaSet. The controller does not do any of the normal operations when trying to introduce a new version since it is trying to revert as fast as possible. A non-fast-track rollback occurs when the scale down annotation has past and the old ReplicaSet has been scaled down. In this case, the Rollout treats the ReplicaSet like any other new ReplicaSet and follows the usual procedure for deploying a new ReplicaSet. What is the argo-rollouts.argoproj.io/managed-by-rollouts annotation? \u00b6 Argo Rollouts adds an argo-rollouts.argoproj.io/managed-by-rollouts annotation to Services and Ingresses that the controller modifies. They are used when the Rollout managing these resources is deleted and the controller tries to revert them back into their previous state. Experiments \u00b6 Why doesn't my Experiment end? \u00b6 An Experiment\u2019s duration is controlled by the .spec.duration field and the analyses created for the Experiment. The .spec.duration indicates how long the ReplicaSets created by the Experiment should run. Once the duration passes, the experiment scales down the ReplicaSets it created and marks the AnalysisRuns successful unless the requiredForCompletion field is used in the Experiment. If enabled, the ReplicaSets are still scaled-down, but the Experiment does not finish until the Analysis Run finishes. Additionally, the .spec.duration is an optional field. If it\u2019s left unset, and the Experiment creates no AnalysisRuns, the ReplicaSets run indefinitely. The Experiment creates AnalysisRuns without the requiredForCompletion field, the Experiment fails only when the AnalysisRun created fails or errors out. If the requiredForCompletion field is set, the Experiment only marks itself as Successful and scales down the created ReplicaSets when the AnalysisRun finishes Successfully. Additionally, an Experiment ends if the .spec.terminate field is set to true regardless of the state of the Experiment. Analysis \u00b6 Why doesn't my AnalysisRun end? \u00b6 The AnalysisRun\u2019s duration is controlled by the metrics specified. Each Metric can specify an interval, count, and various limits (ConsecutiveErrorLimit, InconclusiveLimit, FailureLimit). If the interval is omitted, the AnalysisRun takes a single measurement. The count indicates how many measurements should be taken and causes the AnalysisRun to run indefinitely if omitted. The ConsecutiveErrorLimit, InconclusiveLimit, and FailureLimit define the thresholds allowed before putting the rollout into a completed state. Additionally, an AnalysisRun ends if the .spec.terminate field is set to true regardless of the state of the AnalysisRun. What is the difference between failures and errors? \u00b6 Failures are when the failure condition evaluates to true or an AnalysisRun without a failure condition evaluates the success condition to false. Errors are when the controller has any kind of issue with taking a measurement (i.e. invalid Prometheus URL).","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"FAQ/#does-argo-rollouts-depend-on-argo-cd-or-any-other-argo-project","text":"Argo Rollouts is a standalone project.

Progressive delivery is often described as an evolution of continuous delivery, extending the speed benefits made in CI/CD to the deployment process. This is accomplished by limiting the exposure of the new version to a subset of users, observing and analyzing for correct behavior, then progressively increasing the exposure to a broader and wider audience while continuously verifying correctness. Deployment Strategies \u00b6 While the industry has used a consistent terminology to describe various deployment strategies, the implementations of these strategies tend to differ across tooling. To make it clear how the Argo Rollouts will behave, here are the descriptions of the various deployment strategies implementations offered by the Argo Rollouts. Rolling Update \u00b6 A RollingUpdate slowly replaces the old version with the new version. As the new version comes up, the old version is scaled down in order to maintain the overall count of the application. This is the default strategy of the Deployment object. Recreate \u00b6 A Recreate deployment deletes the old version of the application before bring up the new version. As a result, this ensures that two versions of the application never run at the same time, but there is downtime during the deployment. Blue-Green \u00b6 A Blue-Green deployment (sometimes referred to as a Red-Black) has both the new and old version of the application deployed at the same time. During this time, only the old version of the application will receive production traffic. This allows the developers to run tests against the new version before switching the live traffic to the new version. Canary \u00b6 A Canary deployment exposes a subset of users to the new version of the application while serving the rest of the traffic to the old version. Once the new version is verified to be correct, the new version can gradually replace the old version. Ingress controllers and service meshes such as NGINX and Istio, enable more sophisticated traffic shaping patterns for canarying than what is natively available (e.g. achieving very fine-grained traffic splitting, or splitting based on HTTP headers).

Requirements \u00b6 Kubernetes cluster with argo-rollouts controller installed (see install guide ) kubectl with argo-rollouts plugin installed (see install guide ) 1. Deploying a Rollout \u00b6 First we deploy a Rollout resource and a Kubernetes Service targeting that Rollout. The example Rollout in this guide utilizes a canary update strategy which sends 20% of traffic to the canary, followed by a manual promotion, and finally gradual automated traffic increases for the remainder of the upgrade. This behavior is described in the following portion of the Rollout spec: spec : replicas : 5 strategy : canary : steps : - setWeight : 20 - pause : {} - setWeight : 40 - pause : { duration : 10 } - setWeight : 60 - pause : { duration : 10 } - setWeight : 80 - pause : { duration : 10 } Run the following command to deploy the initial Rollout and Service: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/basic/rollout.yaml kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/basic/service.yaml Initial creations of any Rollout will immediately scale up the replicas to 100% (skipping any canary upgrade steps, analysis, etc...) since there was no upgrade that occurred. The Argo Rollouts kubectl plugin allows you to visualize the Rollout, its related resources (ReplicaSets, Pods, AnalysisRuns), and presents live state changes as they occur. To watch the rollout as it deploys, run the get rollout --watch command from plugin: kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch 2. Updating a Rollout \u00b6 Next it is time to perform an update. Just as with Deployments, any change to the Pod template field ( spec.template ) results in a new version (i.e. ReplicaSet) to be deployed. Updating a Rollout involves modifying the rollout spec, typically changing the container image field with a new version, and then running kubectl apply against the new manifest. As a convenience, the rollouts plugin provides a set image command, which performs these steps against the live rollout object in-place. Run the following command to update the rollouts-demo Rollout with the \"yellow\" version of the container: kubectl argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo \\ rollouts-demo = argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow During a rollout update, the controller will progress through the steps defined in the Rollout's update strategy. The example rollout sets a 20% traffic weight to the canary, and pauses the rollout indefinitely until user action is taken to unpause/promote the rollout. After updating the image, watch the rollout again until it reaches the paused state: kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch When the demo rollout reaches the second step, we can see from the plugin that the Rollout is in a paused state, and now has 1 of 5 replicas running the new version of the pod template, and 4 of 5 replicas running the old version. This equates to the 20% canary weight as defined by the setWeight: 20 step. 3. Promoting a Rollout \u00b6 The rollout is now in a paused state. When a Rollout reaches a pause step with no duration, it will remain in a paused state indefinitely until it is resumed/promoted. To manually promote a rollout to the next step, run the promote command of the plugin: kubectl argo rollouts promote rollouts-demo After promotion, Rollout will proceed to execute the remaining steps. The remaining rollout steps in our example are fully automated, so the Rollout will eventually complete steps until it has has fully transitioned to the new version. Watch the rollout again until it has completed all steps: kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch Tip The promote command also supports the ability to skip all remaining steps and analysis with the --full flag. Once all steps complete successfully, the new ReplicaSet is marked as the \"stable\" ReplicaSet. Whenever a rollout is aborted during an update, either automatically via a failed canary analysis, or manually by a user, the Rollout will fall back to the \"stable\" version. 4. Aborting a Rollout \u00b6 Next we will learn how to manually abort a rollout during an update. First, deploy a new \"red\" version of the container using the set image command, and wait for the rollout to reach the paused step again: kubectl argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo \\ rollouts-demo = argoproj/rollouts-demo:red This time, instead of promoting the rollout to the next step, we will abort the update, so that it falls back to the \"stable\" version. The plugin provides an abort command as a way to manually abort a rollout at any time during an update: kubectl argo rollouts abort rollouts-demo When a rollout is aborted, it will scale up the \"stable\" version of the ReplicaSet (in this case the yellow image), and scale down any other versions. Although the stable version of the ReplicaSet may be running and is healthy, the overall rollout is still considered Degraded , since the desired version (the red image) is not the version which is actually running. In order to make Rollout considered Healthy again and not Degraded, it is necessary to change the desired state back to the previous, stable version. This typically involves running kubectl apply against the previous Rollout spec. In our case, we can simply re-run the set image command using the previous, \"yellow\" image. kubectl argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo \\ rollouts-demo=argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow After running this command, you should notice that the Rollout immediately becomes Healthy, and there is no activity with regards to new ReplicaSets becoming created. When a Rollout has not yet reached its desired state (e.g. it was aborted, or in the middle of an update), and the stable manifest were re-applied, the Rollout detects this as a rollback and not a update, and will fast-track the deployment of the stable ReplicaSet by skipping analysis, and the steps. Summary \u00b6 In this guide, we have learned basic capabilities of Argo Rollouts, including: Deploying a rollout Performing a canary update Manual promotion Manual abortion The Rollout in this basic example did not utilize a ingress controller or service mesh provider to route traffic. Instead, it used normal Kubernetes Service networking (i.e. kube-proxy) to achieve an approximate canary weight, based on the closest ratio of new to old replica counts. As a result, this Rollout had a limitation in that it could only achieve a minimum canary weight of 20%, by scaling 1 of 5 pods to run the new version. In order to achieve much finer grained canaries, an ingress controller or service mesh is necessary. Follow one of the traffic routing guides to see how Argo Rollouts can leverage a networking provider to achieve more advanced traffic shaping.

Watch the rollout again until it has completed all steps: kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch Tip The promote command also supports the ability to skip all remaining steps and analysis with the --full flag. Once all steps complete successfully, the new ReplicaSet is marked as the \"stable\" ReplicaSet. Whenever a rollout is aborted during an update, either automatically via a failed canary analysis, or manually by a user, the Rollout will fall back to the \"stable\" version.","title":"3. Promoting a Rollout"},{"location":"getting-started/#4-aborting-a-rollout","text":"Next we will learn how to manually abort a rollout during an update. First, deploy a new \"red\" version of the container using the set image command, and wait for the rollout to reach the paused step again: kubectl argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo \\ rollouts-demo = argoproj/rollouts-demo:red This time, instead of promoting the rollout to the next step, we will abort the update, so that it falls back to the \"stable\" version. The plugin provides an abort command as a way to manually abort a rollout at any time during an update: kubectl argo rollouts abort rollouts-demo When a rollout is aborted, it will scale up the \"stable\" version of the ReplicaSet (in this case the yellow image), and scale down any other versions. Although the stable version of the ReplicaSet may be running and is healthy, the overall rollout is still considered Degraded , since the desired version (the red image) is not the version which is actually running. In order to make Rollout considered Healthy again and not Degraded, it is necessary to change the desired state back to the previous, stable version. This typically involves running kubectl apply against the previous Rollout spec. In our case, we can simply re-run the set image command using the previous, \"yellow\" image. kubectl argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo \\ rollouts-demo=argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow After running this command, you should notice that the Rollout immediately becomes Healthy, and there is no activity with regards to new ReplicaSets becoming created. When a Rollout has not yet reached its desired state (e.g. it was aborted, or in the middle of an update), and the stable manifest were re-applied, the Rollout detects this as a rollback and not a update, and will fast-track the deployment of the stable ReplicaSet by skipping analysis, and the steps.","title":"4. Aborting a Rollout"},{"location":"getting-started/#summary","text":"In this guide, we have learned basic capabilities of Argo Rollouts, including: Deploying a rollout Performing a canary update Manual promotion Manual abortion The Rollout in this basic example did not utilize a ingress controller or service mesh provider to route traffic. Instead, it used normal Kubernetes Service networking (i.e. kube-proxy) to achieve an approximate canary weight, based on the closest ratio of new to old replica counts. As a result, this Rollout had a limitation in that it could only achieve a minimum canary weight of 20%, by scaling 1 of 5 pods to run the new version. In order to achieve much finer grained canaries, an ingress controller or service mesh is necessary. Follow one of the traffic routing guides to see how Argo Rollouts can leverage a networking provider to achieve more advanced traffic shaping.

Not following this approach might result in downtime . It also allows for the Rollout to be tested before deleting the original Deployment. Reference Deployment From Rollout \u00b6 Instead of removing Deployment you can scale-down in to zero and reference from the Rollout resource: Create a Rollout resource. Reference an existing Deployment using workloadRef field. Scale-down existing Deployment by changing replicas field of an existing Deployment to zero. To perform an update, the change should be made to the Pod template field of the Deployment.

Rollout won't try to manage existing Deployment Pods.

Argo-rollouts controller patches the spec of rollout object with an annotation of rollout.argoproj.io/workload-generation , which equals the generation of referenced deployment.

Traffic Management During Migration The Rollout offers traffic management functionality that manages routing rules and flows the traffic to different versions of an application. For example Blue-Green deployment strategy manipulates Kubernetes Service selector and direct production traffic to \"green\" instances only. If you are using this feature then Rollout switches production traffic to Pods that it manages. The switch happens only when the required number of Pod is running and healthy so it is safe in production as well.

However, for some traffic routing providers, this change can take a long time to take effect (or possibly never even made) since external factors may cause the change to become delayed. This proposal is to add verification to the traffic routers so that after a setWeight step, the rollout controller could verify that the weight took effect before moving on to the next step.

For some use cases (e.g. east-west canarying intra-cluster), this pattern not desirable and traffic splitting should be achieved using two Istio DestinationRule Subsets instead. Workload Referencing \u00b6 Issue #676 Currently, the Rollout spec contains both the deployment strategy (e.g. blueGreen/canary), as well as the pod template. This proposal is to support a way to reference the pod template definition from another group/kind (e.g. a Deployment, PodTemplate) so that the rollout strategy could be separated from the workload definition. This is motivated by the following use cases: CRDs (e.g. Rollouts) are not supported well in kustomize, and strategic merge patches simply don't work as expected with a Rollout because lists will be replaced and not merged. By referencing a native Kubernetes kind, kustomize would work expectedly against the k8s native referenced object, which is the portion of the spec that users typically want to customize overlays against. During a migration from a Deployment to a Rollout, it has been inconvenient for users to duplicate the entire Deployment spec to a Rollout, and keeping them always in sync during the transition.

A webhook notification feature of Rollouts would allow a push-based model where the Rollout controller itself would push an event to an external system, in the form of a webhook/cloud event. Rollback Windows \u00b6 Issue #574 Currently, when an older Rollout manifest is re-applied, the controller treats it the same as a spec change, and will execute the full list of steps, and perform analysis too. There are two exceptions to this rule: 1. the controller detects if it is moving back to a blue-green ReplicaSet which exists and is still scaled up (within its scaleDownDelay) 2. the controller detects it is moving back to the canary's \"stable\" ReplicaSet, and the upgrade had not yet completed.

Header based routing provides the ability to route traffic based on a header, instead of a percentage of traffic. This allows more flexibility when canarying, such as providing session stickiness, or only exposing a subset of users with a HTTP cookie or user-agent.

This document describes how to achieve various forms of progressive delivery, varying the point in time analysis is performed, it's frequency, and occurrence. Custom Resource Definitions \u00b6 CRD Description Rollout A Rollout acts as a drop-in replacement for a Deployment resource. It provides additional blueGreen and canary update strategies. These strategies can create AnalysisRuns and Experiments during the update, which will progress the update, or abort it. AnalysisTemplate An AnalysisTemplate is a template spec which defines how to perform a canary analysis, such as the metrics which it should perform, its frequency, and the values which are considered successful or failed. AnalysisTemplates may be parameterized with inputs values. ClusterAnalysisTemplate A ClusterAnalysisTemplate is like an AnalysisTemplate , but it is not limited to its namespace. It can be used by any Rollout throughout the cluster. AnalysisRun An AnalysisRun is an instantiation of an AnalysisTemplate . AnalysisRuns are like Jobs in that they eventually complete. Completed runs are considered Successful, Failed, or Inconclusive, and the result of the run affect if the Rollout's update will continue, abort, or pause, respectively. Experiment An Experiment is limited run of one or more ReplicaSets for the purposes of analysis. Experiments typically run for a pre-determined duration, but can also run indefinitely until stopped. Experiments may reference an AnalysisTemplate to run during or after the experiment. The canonical use case for an Experiment is to start a baseline and canary deployment in parallel, and compare the metrics produced by the baseline and canary pods for an equal comparison. Background Analysis \u00b6 Analysis can be run in the background -- while the canary is progressing through its rollout steps. The following example gradually increments the canary weight by 20% every 10 minutes until it reaches 100%. In the background, an AnalysisRun is started based on the AnalysisTemplate named success-rate . The success-rate template queries a prometheus server, measuring the HTTP success rates at 5 minute intervals/samples. It has no end time, and continues until stopped or failed. If the metric is measured to be less than 95%, and there are three such measurements, the analysis is considered Failed. The failed analysis causes the Rollout to abort, setting the canary weight back to zero, and the Rollout would be considered in a Degraded . Otherwise, if the rollout completes all of its canary steps, the rollout is considered successful and the analysis run is stopped by the controller. This example highlights: Background analysis style of progressive delivery Using a Prometheus query to perform a measurement The ability to parameterize the analysis Delay starting the analysis run until step 3 (Set Weight 40%) Rollout apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook spec : ... strategy : canary : analysis : templates : - templateName : success-rate startingStep : 2 # delay starting analysis run until setWeight: 40% args : - name : service-name value : guestbook-svc.default.svc.cluster.local steps : - setWeight : 20 - pause : { duration : 10m } - setWeight : 40 - pause : { duration : 10m } - setWeight : 60 - pause : { duration : 10m } - setWeight : 80 - pause : { duration : 10m } AnalysisTemplate apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisTemplate metadata : name : success-rate spec : args : - name : service-name metrics : - name : success-rate interval : 5m # NOTE: prometheus queries return results in the form of a vector. # So it is common to access the index 0 of the returned array to obtain the value successCondition : result[0] >= 0.95 failureLimit : 3 provider : prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : | sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter=\"source\",destination_service=~\"{{args.service-name}}\",response_code!~\"5.*\"}[5m] )) / sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter=\"source\",destination_service=~\"{{args.service-name}}\"}[5m] )) Inline Analysis \u00b6 Analysis can also be performed as a rollout step as an inline \"analysis\" step. When analysis is performed \"inlined,\" an AnalysisRun is started when the step is reached, and blocks the rollout until the run is completed. The success or failure of the analysis run decides if the rollout will proceed to the next step, or abort the rollout completely. This example sets the canary weight to 20%, pauses for 5 minutes, then runs an analysis. If the analysis was successful, continues with rollout, otherwise aborts. This example demonstrates: The ability to invoke an analysis in-line as part of steps apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook spec : ... strategy : canary : steps : - setWeight : 20 - pause : { duration : 5m } - analysis : templates : - templateName : success-rate args : - name : service-name value : guestbook-svc.default.svc.cluster.local In this example, the AnalysisTemplate is identical to the background analysis example, but since no interval is specified, the analysis will perform a single measurement and complete. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisTemplate metadata : name : success-rate spec : args : - name : service-name - name : prometheus-port value : 9090 metrics : - name : success-rate successCondition : result[0] >= 0.95 provider : prometheus : address : \"http://prometheus.example.com:{{args.prometheus-port}}\" query : | sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter=\"source\",destination_service=~\"{{args.service-name}}\",response_code!~\"5.*\"}[5m] )) / sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter=\"source\",destination_service=~\"{{args.service-name}}\"}[5m] )) Multiple measurements can be performed over a longer duration period, by specifying the count and interval fields: metrics : - name : success-rate successCondition : result[0] >= 0.95 interval : 60s count : 5 provider : prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : ... ClusterAnalysisTemplates \u00b6 Important Available since v0.9.0 A Rollout can reference a Cluster scoped AnalysisTemplate called a ClusterAnalysisTemplate . This can be useful when you want to share an AnalysisTemplate across multiple Rollouts; in different namespaces, and avoid duplicating the same template in every namespace. Use the field clusterScope: true to reference a ClusterAnalysisTemplate instead of an AnalysisTemplate.

This allows users to compose analysis from multiple AnalysisTemplates. If multiple templates are referenced, then the controller will merge the templates together. The controller combines the metrics and args fields of all the templates.

The args can then be used as in metrics configuration and are resolved at the time the AnalysisRun is created. Argument placeholders are defined as {{ args.<name> }} . apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisTemplate metadata : name : args-example spec : args : # required - name : service-name - name : stable-hash - name : latest-hash # optional - name : api-url value : http://example/measure # from secret - name : api-token valueFrom : secretKeyRef : name : token-secret key : apiToken metrics : - name : webmetric successCondition : result == 'true' provider : web : # placeholders are resolved when an AnalysisRun is created url : \"{{ args.api-url }}?service={{ args.service-name }}\" headers : - key : Authorization value : \"Bearer {{ args.api-token }}\" jsonPath : \"{$.results.ok}\" Analysis arguments defined in a Rollout are merged with the args from the AnalysisTemplate when the AnalysisRun is created. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook spec : ... strategy : canary : analysis : templates : - templateName : args-example args : # required value - name : service-name value : guestbook-svc.default.svc.cluster.local # override default value - name : api-url value : http://other-api # pod template hash from the stable ReplicaSet - name : stable-hash valueFrom : podTemplateHashValue : Stable # pod template hash from the latest ReplicaSet - name : latest-hash valueFrom : podTemplateHashValue : Latest Analysis arguments also support valueFrom for reading metadata fields and passing them as arguments to AnalysisTemplate. An example would be to reference metadata labels like env and region and passing them along to AnalysisTemplate. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook labels : appType : demo-app buildType : nginx-app ... env : dev region : us-west-2 spec : ... strategy : canary : analysis : templates : - templateName : args-example args : ... - name : env valueFrom : fieldRef : fieldPath : metadata.labels['env'] # region where this app is deployed - name : region valueFrom : fieldRef : fieldPath : metadata.labels['region'] BlueGreen Pre Promotion Analysis \u00b6 A Rollout using the BlueGreen strategy can launch an AnalysisRun before it switches traffic to the new version using pre-promotion. This can be used to block the Service selector switch until the AnalysisRun finishes successfully. The success or failure of the AnalysisRun decides if the Rollout switches traffic, or abort the Rollout completely. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook spec : ... strategy : blueGreen : activeService : active-svc previewService : preview-svc prePromotionAnalysis : templates : - templateName : smoke-tests args : - name : service-name value : preview-svc.default.svc.cluster.local In this example, the Rollout creates a pre-promotion AnalysisRun once the new ReplicaSet is fully available. The Rollout will not switch traffic to the new version until the analysis run finishes successfully. Note: if the autoPromotionSeconds field is specified and the Rollout has waited auto promotion seconds amount of time, the Rollout marks the AnalysisRun successful and switches the traffic to a new version automatically. If the AnalysisRun completes before then, the Rollout will not create another AnalysisRun and wait out the rest of the autoPromotionSeconds . BlueGreen Post Promotion Analysis \u00b6 A Rollout using a BlueGreen strategy can launch an analysis run after the traffic switch to the new version using post-promotion analysis. If post-promotion Analysis fails or errors, the Rollout enters an aborted state and switches traffic back to the previous stable Replicaset. When post-analysis is Successful, the Rollout is considered fully promoted and the new ReplicaSet will be marked as stable. The old ReplicaSet will then be scaled down according to scaleDownDelaySeconds (default 30 seconds). apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook spec : ... strategy : blueGreen : activeService : active-svc previewService : preview-svc scaleDownDelaySeconds : 600 # 10 minutes postPromotionAnalysis : templates : - templateName : smoke-tests args : - name : service-name value : preview-svc.default.svc.cluster.local Failure Conditions \u00b6 failureCondition can be used to cause an analysis run to fail. The following example continually polls a prometheus server to get the total number of errors every 5 minutes, causing the analysis run to fail if 10 or more errors were encountered. metrics : - name : total-errors interval : 5m failureCondition : result[0] >= 10 failureLimit : 3 provider : prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : | sum(irate( istio_requests_total{reporter=\"source\",destination_service=~\"{{args.service-name}}\",response_code~\"5.*\"}[5m] )) Inconclusive Runs \u00b6 Analysis runs can also be considered Inconclusive , which indicates the run was neither successful, nor failed. Inconclusive runs causes a rollout to become paused at its current step. Manual intervention is then needed to either resume the rollout, or abort. One example of how analysis runs could become Inconclusive , is when a metric defines no success or failure conditions. metrics : - name : my-query provider : prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : ... Inconclusive analysis runs might also happen when both success and failure conditions are specified, but the measurement value did not meet either condition. metrics : - name : success-rate successCondition : result[0] >= 0.90 failureCondition : result[0] < 0.50 provider : prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : ... A use case for having Inconclusive analysis runs are to enable Argo Rollouts to automate the execution of analysis runs, and collect the measurement, but still allow human judgement to decide whether or not measurement value is acceptable and decide to proceed or abort. Delay Analysis Runs \u00b6 If the analysis run does not need to start immediately (i.e give the metric provider time to collect metrics on the canary version), Analysis Runs can delay the specific metric analysis. Each metric can be configured to have a different delay. In additional to the metric specific delays, the rollouts with background analysis can delay creating an analysis run until a certain step is reached Delaying a specific analysis metric: metrics : - name : success-rate # Do not start this analysis until 5 minutes after the analysis run starts initialDelay : 5m successCondition : result[0] >= 0.90 provider : prometheus : address : http://prometheus.example.com:9090 query : ... Delaying starting background analysis run until step 3 (Set Weight 40%): apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook spec : strategy : canary : analysis : templates : - templateName : success-rate startingStep : 2 steps : - setWeight : 20 - pause : { duration : 10m } - setWeight : 40 - pause : { duration : 10m } Referencing Secrets \u00b6 AnalysisTemplates and AnalysisRuns can reference secret objects in .spec.args . This allows users to securely pass authentication information to Metric Providers, like login credentials or API tokens. An AnalysisRun can only reference secrets from the same namespace as it's running in. This is only relevant for AnalysisRuns, since AnalysisTemplates do not resolve the secret. In the following example, an AnalysisTemplate references an API token and passes it to a Web metric provider. This example demonstrates: The ability to reference a secret in the AnalysisTemplate .spec.args The ability to pass secret arguments to Metric Providers apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisTemplate spec : args : - name : api-token valueFrom : secretKeyRef : name : token-secret key : apiToken metrics : - name : webmetric provider : web : headers : - key : Authorization value : \"Bearer {{ args.api-token }}\" Handling Metric Results \u00b6 NaN and Infinity \u00b6 Metric providers can sometimes return values of NaN (not a number) and infinity. Users can edit the successCondition and failureCondition fields to handle these cases accordingly. Here are three examples where a metric result of NaN is considered successful, inconclusive and failed respectively. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisRun ... successCondition : isNaN(result) || result >= 0.95 status : metricResults : - count : 1 measurements : - finishedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" phase : Successful startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" value : NaN name : success-rate phase : Successful successful : 1 phase : Successful startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisRun ... successCondition : result >= 0.95 failureCondition : result < 0.95 status : metricResults : - count : 1 measurements : - finishedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" phase : Inconclusive startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" value : NaN name : success-rate phase : Inconclusive successful : 1 phase : Inconclusive startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisRun ... successCondition : result >= 0.95 status : metricResults : - count : 1 measurements : - finishedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" phase : Failed startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" value : NaN name : success-rate phase : Failed successful : 1 phase : Failed startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" Here are two examples where a metric result of infinity is considered successful and failed respectively. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisRun ... successCondition : result >= 0.95 status : metricResults : - count : 1 measurements : - finishedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" phase : Successful startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" value : +Inf name : success-rate phase : Successful successful : 1 phase : Successful startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisRun ... failureCondition : isInf(result) status : metricResults : - count : 1 measurements : - finishedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" phase : Failed startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" value : +Inf name : success-rate phase : Failed successful : 1 phase : Failed startedAt : \"2021-02-10T00:15:26Z\" Empty array \u00b6 Prometheus \u00b6 Metric providers can sometimes return empty array, e.g., no data returned from prometheus query. Here are two examples where a metric result of empty array is considered successful and failed respectively. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisRun ... successCondition : len(result) == 0 || result >= 0.95 status : metricResults : - count : 1 measurements : - finishedAt : \"2021-09-08T19:15:49Z\" phase : Successful startedAt : \"2021-09-08T19:15:49Z\" value : '[]' name : success-rate phase : Successful successful : 1 phase : Successful startedAt : \"2021-09-08T19:15:49Z\" apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : AnalysisRun ... successCondition : len(result) > 0 && result >= 0.95 status : metricResults : - count : 1 measurements : - finishedAt : \"2021-09-08T19:19:44Z\" phase : Failed startedAt : \"2021-09-08T19:19:44Z\" value : '[]' name : success-rate phase : Failed successful : 1 phase : Failed startedAt : \"2021-09-08T19:19:44Z\" Datadog \u00b6 Datadog queries can return empty results if the query takes place during a time interval with no metrics. The Datadog provider will return a nil value yielding an error during the evaluation phase like: invalid operation: < (mismatched types <nil> and float64) However, empty query results yielding a nil value can be handled using the default() function. Here is a succeeding example using the default() function: successCondition : default(result, 0) < 0.05","title":"Overview"},{"location":"features/analysis/#analysis-progressive-delivery","text":"Argo Rollouts provides several ways to perform analysis to drive progressive delivery.

Overview \u00b6 In addition to managing ReplicaSets, the rollout controller will modify a Service resource during the BlueGreenUpdate strategy. The Rollout spec has users specify a reference to active service and optionally a preview service in the same namespace. The active Service is used to send regular application traffic to the old version, while the preview Service is used as funnel traffic to the new version. The rollout controller ensures proper traffic routing by injecting a unique hash of the ReplicaSet to these services' selectors. This allows the rollout to define an active and preview stack and a process to migrate replica sets from the preview to the active. When there is a change to the .spec.template field of a rollout, the controller will create the new ReplicaSet. If the active service is not sending traffic to a ReplicaSet, the controller will immediately start sending traffic to the ReplicaSet. Otherwise, the active service will point at the old ReplicaSet while the ReplicaSet becomes available. Once the new ReplicaSet becomes available, the controller will modify the active service to point at the new ReplicaSet. After waiting some time configured by the .spec.strategy.blueGreen.scaleDownDelaySeconds , the controller will scale down the old ReplicaSet. Important When the rollout changes the selector on a service, there is a propagation delay before all the nodes update their IP tables to send traffic to the new pods instead of the old. During this delay, traffic will be directed to the old pods if the nodes have not been updated yet. In order to prevent the packets from being sent to a node that killed the old pod, the rollout uses the scaleDownDelaySeconds field to give nodes enough time to broadcast the IP table changes.

Beginning at a fully promoted, steady-state, a revision 1 ReplicaSet is pointed to by both the activeService and previewService . A user initiates an update by modifying the pod template ( spec.template.spec ). The revision 2 ReplicaSet is created with size 0. The preview service is modified to point to the revision 2 ReplicaSet. The activeService remains pointing to revision 1. The revision 2 ReplicaSet is scaled to either spec.replicas or previewReplicaCount if set. Once revision 2 ReplicaSet Pods are fully available, prePromotionAnalysis begins. Upon success of prePromotionAnalysis , the blue/green pauses if autoPromotionEnabled is false, or autoPromotionSeconds is non-zero. The rollout is resumed either manually by a user, or automatically by surpassing autoPromotionSeconds . The revision 2 ReplicaSet is scaled to the spec.replicas , if the previewReplicaCount feature was used. The rollout \"promotes\" the revision 2 ReplicaSet by updating the activeService to point to it. At this point, there are no services pointing to revision 1 postPromotionAnalysis analysis begins Once postPromotionAnalysis completes successfully, the update is successful and the revision 2 ReplicaSet is marked as stable. The rollout is considered fully-promoted. After waiting scaleDownDelaySeconds (default 30 seconds), the revision 1 ReplicaSet is scaled down autoPromotionEnabled \u00b6 The AutoPromotionEnabled will make the rollout automatically promote the new ReplicaSet to the active service once the new ReplicaSet is healthy. This field is defaulted to true if it is not specified.

The success or failure of the analysis run decides if the Rollout will switch traffic, or abort the Rollout completely. Defaults to nil postPromotionAnalysis \u00b6 Configures the Analysis after the traffic switch to new version. If the analysis run fails or errors out, the Rollout enters an aborted state and switch traffic back to the previous stable Replicaset.

If it is omitted, and post analysis is specified, it will scale down the ReplicaSet only after the AnalysisRun completes (with a minimum of 30 seconds). Defaults to nil previewService \u00b6 The PreviewService field references a Service that will be modified to send traffic to the new ReplicaSet before the new one is promoted to receiving traffic from the active service. Once the new ReplicaSet starts receiving traffic from the active service, the preview service will also be modified to send traffic to the new ReplicaSet as well. The Rollout always makes sure that the preview service is sending traffic to the newest ReplicaSet. As a result, if a new version is introduced before the old version is promoted to the active service, the controller will immediately switch over to that brand new version. This feature is used to provide an endpoint that can be used to test a new version of an application. Defaults to an empty string previewReplicaCount \u00b6 The PreviewReplicaCount field will indicate the number of replicas that the new version of an application should run. Once the application is ready to promote to the active service, the controller will scale the new ReplicaSet to the value of the spec.replicas . The rollout will not switch over the active service to the new ReplicaSet until it matches the spec.replicas count. This feature is mainly used to save resources during the testing phase.

Overview \u00b6 Since there is no agreed upon standard for a canary deployment, the rollouts controller allows users to outline how they want to run their canary deployment. Users can define a list of steps the controller uses to manipulate the ReplicaSets when there is a change to the .spec.template . Each step will be evaluated before the new ReplicaSet is promoted to the stable version, and the old version is completely scaled down. Each step can have one of two fields. The setWeight field dictates the percentage of traffic that should be sent to the canary, and the pause struct instructs the rollout to pause. When the controller reaches a pause step for a rollout, it will set adds a PauseCondition struct to the .status.PauseConditions field. If the duration field within the pause struct is set, the rollout will not progress to the next step until it has waited for the value of the duration field. Otherwise, the rollout will wait indefinitely until that Pause condition is removed. By using the setWeight and the pause fields, a user can declarative describe how they want to progress to the new version. Below is an example of a canary strategy. Important If the canary Rollout does not use traffic management , the Rollout makes a best effort attempt to achieve the percentage listed in the last setWeight step between the new and old version. For example, if a Rollout has 10 Replicas and 10% for the first setWeight step, the controller will scale the new desired ReplicaSet to 1 replicas and the old stable ReplicaSet to 9. In the case where the setWeight is 15%, the Rollout attempts to get there by rounding up the calculation (i.e. the new ReplicaSet has 2 pods since 15% of 10, rounds up to 2 and the old ReplicaSet has 9 pods since 85% of 10, rounds up to 9). If a user wants to have more fine-grained control of the percentages without a large number of Replicas, that user should use the traffic management functionality.

To unpause, use the argo kubectl plugin promote command. # promote to the next step kubectl argo rollouts promote <rollout> Dynamic Canary Scale (with Traffic Routing) \u00b6 By default, the rollout controller will scale the canary to match the current trafficWeight of the current step. For example, if the current weight is 25%, and there are four replicas, then the canary will be scaled to 1, to match the traffic weight. It is possible to control the canary replica's scale during the steps such that it does not necessary match the traffic weight. Some use cases for this: The new version should not yet be exposed to the public (setWeight: 0), but you would like to scale the canary up for testing purposes. You wish to scale the canary stack up minimally, and use some header based traffic shaping to the canary, while setWeight is still set to 0. You wish to scale the canary up to 100%, in order to facilitate traffic shadowing. Important Setting canary scale is only available when using the canary strategy with a traffic router, since the basic canary needs to control canary scale in order to approximate canary weight. To control canary weights during steps, use the setCanaryScale step and indicate which scale the the canary should use: explicit replica count explicit weight percentage of total spec.replicas to match current canary setWeight spec : strategy : canary : steps : # explicit count - setCanaryScale : replicas : 3 # a percentage of spec.replicas - setCanaryScale : weight : 25 # matchTrafficWeight returns to the default behavior of matching the canary traffic weight - setCanaryScale : matchTrafficWeight : true When using setCanaryScale with explicit values for either replicas or weight, one must be careful if used in conjunction with the setWeight step. If done incorrectly, an imbalanced amount of traffic may be directed to the canary (in proportion to the Rollout's scale). For example, the following set of steps would cause 90% of traffic to only be served by 10% of pods: spec : replicas : 10 strategy : canary : steps : - setCanaryScale : weight : 10 - setWeight : 90 - pause : {} Dynamic Stable Scale (with Traffic Routing) \u00b6 Important Available since v1.1 When using traffic routing, by default the stable ReplicaSet is left scaled to 100% during the update. This has the advantage that if an abort occurs, traffic can be immediately shifted back to the stable ReplicaSet without delay. However, it has the disadvantage that during the update, there will eventually exist double the number of replica pods running (similar to in a blue-green deployment), since the stable ReplicaSet is left scaled up for the full duration of the update. It is possible to dynamically reduce the scale of the stable ReplicaSet during an update such that it scales down as the traffic weight increases to canary. This would be desirable in scenarios where the Rollout has a high replica count and resource cost is a concern, or in bare-metal situations where it is not possible to create additional node capacity to accommodate double the replicas. The ability to dynamically scale the stable ReplicaSet can be enabled by setting the canary.dynamicStableScale flag to true: spec : strategy : canary : dynamicStableScale : true NOTE: that if dynamicStableScale is set, and the rollout is aborted, the canary ReplicaSet will dynamically scale down as traffic shifts back to stable. If you wish to leave the canary ReplicaSet scaled up while aborting, an explicit value for abortScaleDownDelaySeconds can be set: spec : strategy : canary : dynamicStableScale : true abortScaleDownDelaySeconds : 600 Mimicking Rolling Update \u00b6 If the steps field is omitted, the canary strategy will mimic the rolling update behavior. Similar to the deployment, the canary strategy has the maxSurge and maxUnavailable fields to configure how the Rollout should progress to the new version.

In addition to running ephemeral ReplicaSets, the Experiment CRD can launch AnalysisRuns alongside the ReplicaSets. Generally, those AnalysisRun is used to confirm that new ReplicaSets are running as expected. Use cases of Experiments \u00b6 A user wants to run two versions of an application for a specific duration to enable Kayenta-style analysis of their application. The Experiment CRD creates 2 ReplicaSets (a baseline and a canary) based on the spec.templates field of the Experiment and waits until both are healthy. After the duration passes, the Experiment scales down the ReplicaSets, and the user can start the Kayenta analysis run. A user can use experiments to enable A/B/C testing by launching multiple experiments with a different version of their application for a long duration. Each Experiment has one PodSpec template that defines a specific version a user would want to run. The Experiment allows users to launch multiple experiments at once and keep each Experiment self-contained. Launching a new version of an existing application with different labels to avoid receiving traffic from a Kubernetes service. The user can run tests against the new version before continuing the Rollout.

If an AnalysisRun fails or errors, the Experiment will end prematurely, with a status equal to the unsuccessful AnalysisRun (i.e. Failed or Error ) If one or more of the referenced AnalysisTemplates is marked with requiredForCompletion: true , the Experiment will not complete until those AnalysisRuns have completed, even if it exceeds the Experiment duration. If neither a spec.duration or requiredForCompletion: true is specified, the Experiment will run indefinitely, until explicitly terminated (by setting spec.terminate: true ). Once an Experiment is complete, the ReplicaSets will be scaled to zero, and any incomplete AnalysisRuns will be terminated. Note ReplicaSet names are generated by combining the Experiment name with the template name. Integration With Rollouts \u00b6 A rollout using the Canary strategy can create an experiment using an experiment step. The experiment step serves as a blocking step for the Rollout, and a Rollout will not continue until the Experiment succeeds. The Rollout creates an Experiment using the configuration in the experiment step of the Rollout. If the Experiment fails or errors, the Rollout will abort. Note Experiment names are generated by combining the Rollout's name, the PodHash of the new ReplicaSet, the current revision of the Rollout, and the current step-index. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : guestbook labels : app : guestbook spec : ... strategy : canary : steps : - experiment : duration : 1h templates : - name : baseline specRef : stable - name : canary specRef : canary analyses : - name : mann-whitney templateName : mann-whitney args : - name : baseline-hash value : \"{{templates.baseline.podTemplateHash}}\" - name : canary-hash value : \"{{templates.canary.podTemplateHash}}\" In the example above, during an update of a Rollout, the Rollout will launch an Experiment. The Experiment will create two ReplicaSets: baseline and canary , with one replica each, and will run for one hour. The baseline template uses the PodSpec from the stable ReplicaSet, and the canary template uses the PodSpec from the canary ReplicaSet. Additionally, the Experiment will perform analysis using the AnalysisTemplate named mann-whitney . The AnalysisRun is supplied with the pod-hash details of the baseline and canary to perform the necessary metrics queries, using the {{templates.baseline.podTemplateHash}} and {{templates.canary.podTemplateHash}} variables respectively. Note The pod-hashes of the baseline / canary ReplicaSets created by the Experiment, will have different values than the pod-hashes of the stable / canary ReplicaSets created by the Rollout. This is despite the fact that the PodSpec are the same. This is intentional behavior, in order to allow the metrics of the Experiment's pods to be delineated and queried separately from the metrics of the Rollout pods. Weighted Experiment Step with Traffic Routing \u00b6 Important Available since v1.1 A Rollout using the Canary strategy along with Traffic Routing can split traffic to an experiment stack in a fine-grained manner. When Traffic Routing is enabled, the Rollout Experiment step allows traffic to be shifted to experiment pods.

When pods are ready (Experiment enters Running phase), the rollout would direct 5% of traffic to experiment-canary and 5% to experiment-baseline , leaving the remaining 90% of traffic to the old stack. Note When a weighted experiment step with traffic routing is used, a service is auto-created for each experiment template.

Configuration \u00b6 The trigger defines the condition when the notification should be sent as well as the notification content template. Default Argo Rollouts comes with a list of built-in triggers that cover the most important events of Argo Rollout live-cycle. Both triggers and templates are configured in the argo-rollouts-notification-configmap ConfigMap. In order to get started quickly, you can use pre-configured notification templates defined in notifications-install.yaml . If you are leveraging Kustomize it is recommended to include notifications-install.yaml as a remote resource into your kustomization.yaml file: apiVersion : kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind : Kustomization resources : - https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml - https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/notifications-install.yaml After including the argo-rollouts-notification-configmap ConfigMap the administrator needs to configure integration with the required notifications service such as Slack or MS Teams.

Templates \u00b6 The notification template is a stateless function that generates the notification content. The template is leveraging html/template golang package. It is meant to be reusable and can be referenced by multiple triggers. An example below demonstrates a sample template: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argo-rollouts-notification-configmap data : template.my-purple-template : | message: | Rollout {{.rollout.metadata.name}} has purple image slack: attachments: | [{ \"title\": \"{{ .rollout.metadata.name}}\", \"color\": \"#800080\" }] Each template has access to the following fields: rollout holds the rollout object. recipient holds the recipient name. The message field of the template definition allows creating a basic notification for any notification service. You can leverage notification service-specific fields to create complex notifications. For example using service-specific you can add blocks and attachments for Slack, subject for Email or URL path, and body for Webhook. See corresponding service documentation for more information. Custom Triggers \u00b6 In addition to custom notification template administrator and configure custom triggers. Custom trigger defines the condition when the notification should be sent. The definition includes name, condition and notification templates reference. The condition is a predicate expression that returns true if the notification should be sent. The trigger condition evaluation is powered by antonmedv/expr . The condition language syntax is described at Language-Definition.md . The trigger is configured in argo-rollouts-notification-configmap ConfigMap. For example the following trigger sends a notification when rollout pod spec uses argoproj/rollouts-demo:purple image: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : argo-rollouts-notification-configmap data : trigger.on-purple : | - send: [my-purple-template] when: rollout.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image == 'argoproj/rollouts-demo:purple' Each condition might use several templates.

In these scenarios, it is undesirable to go through an entire blue-green or canary update process. Argo Rollouts supports the ability to restart all of its Pods by performing a rolling recreate of all the Pods in a Rollout while skipping the regular BlueGreen or Canary update strategy. How it works \u00b6 A rollout can be restarted via the kubectl plugin, using the restart command : kubectl-argo-rollouts restart ROLLOUT Alternatively, if Rollouts is used with Argo CD, the there is a bundled \"restart\" action which can be performed via the Argo CD UI or CLI: argocd app actions run my-app restart --kind Rollout --resource-name my-rollout Both of these mechanisms updates the Rollout's .spec.restartAt to the current time in the form of a RFC 3339 formatted UTC string (e.g. 2020-03-30T21:19:35Z), which indicates to the Rollout controller that all of a Rollout's Pods should have been created after this timestamp. During a restart, the controller iterates through each ReplicaSet to see if all the Pods have a creation timestamp which is newer than the restartAt time. For every pod older than the restartAt timestamp, the Pod will be evicted, allowing the ReplicaSet to replace the pod with a recreated one. To prevent too many Pods from restarting at once, the controller limits itself to deleting up to maxUnavailable Pods at a time. Secondly, since pods are evicted and not deleted, the restart process will honor any PodDisruptionBudgets which are in place. The controller restarts ReplicaSets in the following order: 1. stable ReplicaSet 2. current ReplicaSet 3. all other ReplicaSets beginning with the oldest If a Rollout's pod template spec ( spec.template ) is modified in the middle of a restart, the restart is canceled, and the normal blue-green or canary update will occur. Note: Unlike deployments, where a \"restart\" is nothing but a normal rolling upgrade that happened to be triggered by a timestamp in the pod spec annotation, Argo Rollouts facilitates restarts by terminating pods and allowing the existing ReplicaSet to replace the terminated pods. This design choice was made in order to allow a restart to occur even when a Rollout was in the middle of a long-running blue-green/canary update (e.g. a paused canary). However, some consequences of this are: Restarting a Rollout which has a single replica will cause downtime since Argo Rollouts needs to terminate the pod in order to replace it. Restarting a rollout will be slower than a deployment's rolling update, since maxSurge is not used to bring up newer pods faster. maxUnavailable will be used to restart multiple pods at a time (starting in v0.10). But if maxUnavailable pods is 0, the controller will still restart pods one at a time. Scheduled Restarts \u00b6 Users can schedule a restart on their Rollout by setting the .spec.restartAt field to a time in the future.

This behavior occurs because cluster auto-scaler wants to scale down the extra capacity which was created to support a Rollout running in double capacity.

ALBs provides advanced traffic splitting capability through the concept of weighted target groups . This feature is supported by the AWS Load Balancer Controller through annotations made to the Ingress object to configure \"actions.\" How it works \u00b6 ALBs are configured via Listeners, and Rules which contain Actions. Listeners define how traffic from a client comes in, and Rules define how to handle those requests with various Actions. One type of Action allows users to forward traffic to multiple TargetGroups (with each being defined as a Kubernetes service). You can read more about ALB concepts here . An Ingress which is managed by the AWS Load Balancer Controller, controls an ALB's Listener and Rules through the Ingress' annotations and spec. In order to split traffic among multiple target groups (e.g. different Kubernetes services), the AWS Load Balancer controller looks to a specific \"action\" annotation on the Ingress, alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.<service-name> . This annotation is injected and updated automatically by a Rollout during an update according to the desired traffic weights. Usage \u00b6 To configure a Rollout to use the ALB integration and split traffic between the canary and stable services during updates, the Rollout should be configured with the following fields: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout ... spec : strategy : canary : # canaryService and stableService are references to Services which the Rollout will modify # to target the canary ReplicaSet and stable ReplicaSet respectively (required). canaryService : canary-service stableService : stable-service trafficRouting : alb : # The referenced ingress will be injected with a custom action annotation, directing # the AWS Load Balancer Controller to split traffic between the canary and stable # Service, according to the desired traffic weight (required). ingress : ingress # Reference to a Service that the Ingress must target in one of the rules (optional). # If omitted, uses canary.stableService. rootService : root-service # Service port is the port which the Service listens on (required). servicePort : 443 The referenced Ingress should be deployed with an ingress rule that matches the Rollout service: apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : ingress annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : alb spec : rules : - http : paths : - path : /* backend : # serviceName must match either: canary.trafficRouting.alb.rootService (if specified), # or canary.stableService (if rootService is omitted) serviceName : root-service # servicePort must be the value: use-annotation # This instructs AWS Load Balancer Controller to look to annotations on how to direct traffic servicePort : use-annotation During an update, the rollout controller injects the alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.<SERVICE-NAME> annotation, containing a JSON payload understood by the AWS Load Balancer Controller, directing it to split traffic between the canaryService and stableService according to the current canary weight. The following is an example of our example Ingress after the rollout has injected the custom action annotation that splits traffic between the canary-service and stable-service, with a traffic weight of 80 and 20 respectively: apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : ingress annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : alb alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.root-service : | { \"Type\":\"forward\", \"ForwardConfig\":{ \"TargetGroups\":[ { \"Weight\":10, \"ServiceName\":\"canary-service\", \"ServicePort\":\"80\" }, { \"Weight\":90, \"ServiceName\":\"stable-service\", \"ServicePort\":\"80\" } ] } } spec : rules : - http : paths : - path : /* backend : serviceName : root-service servicePort : use-annotation Note Argo rollouts additionally injects an annotation, rollouts.argoproj.io/managed-alb-actions , to the Ingress for bookkeeping purposes. The annotation indicates which actions are being managed by the Rollout object (since multiple Rollouts can reference one Ingress). Upon a rollout deletion, the rollout controller looks to this annotation to understand that this action is no longer managed, and is reset to point only the stable service with 100 weight. rootService \u00b6 By default, a rollout will inject the alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.<SERVICE-NAME> annotation using the service/action name specified under spec.strategy.canary.stableService . However, it may be desirable to specify an explicit service/action name different from the stableService . For example, one pattern is to use a single Ingress containing three different rules to reach the canary, stable, and root service separately (e.g. for testing purposes). In this case, you may want to specify a \"root\" service as the service/action name instead of stable. To do so, reference a service under rootService under the alb specification: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout spec : strategy : canary : canaryService : guestbook-canary stableService : guestbook-stable trafficRouting : alb : rootService : guestbook-root ... Zero-Downtime Updates with AWS TargetGroup Verification \u00b6 Argo Rollouts contains two features to help ensure zero-downtime updates when used with the AWS LoadBalancer controller: TargetGroup IP verification and TargetGroup weight verification. Both features involve the Rollout controller performing additional safety checks to AWS, to verify the changes made to the Ingress object are reflected in the underlying AWS TargetGroup. TargetGroup IP Verification \u00b6 Note Target Group IP verification available since Argo Rollouts v1.1 The AWS LoadBalancer controller can run in one of two modes: Instance mode IP mode TargetGroup IP Verification is only applicable when the AWS LoadBalancer controller in IP mode. When using the AWS LoadBalancer controller in IP mode (e.g. using the AWS CNI), the ALB LoadBalancer targets individual Pod IPs, as opposed to K8s node instances. Targeting Pod IPs comes with an increased risk of downtime during an update, because the Pod IPs behind the underlying AWS TargetGroup can more easily become outdated from the actual availability and status of pods, causing HTTP 502 errors when the TargetGroup points to pods which have already been scaled down. To mitigate this risk, AWS recommends the use of pod readiness gate injection when running the AWS LoadBalancer in IP mode. Readiness gates allow for the AWS LoadBalancer controller to verify that TargetGroups are accurate before marking newly created Pods as \"ready\", preventing premature scale down of the older ReplicaSet. Pod readiness gate injection uses a mutating webhook which decides to inject readiness gates when a pod is created based on the following conditions: * There exists a service matching the pod labels in the same namespace * There exists at least one target group binding that refers to the matching service Another way to describe this is: the AWS LoadBalancer controller injects readiness gates onto Pods only if they are \"reachable\" from an ALB Ingress at the time of pod creation. A pod is considered reachable if an (ALB) Ingress references a Service which matches the pod labels. It ignores all other Pods. One challenge with this manner of pod readiness gate injection, is that modifications to the Service selector labels ( spec.selector ) do not allow for the AWS LoadBalancer controller to inject the readiness gates, because by that time the Pod was already created (and readiness gates are immutable). Note that this is an issue when you change Service selectors of any ALB Service, not just ones involved in Argo Rollouts. Because Argo Rollout's blue-green strategy works by modifying the activeService selector to the new ReplicaSet labels during promotion, it suffers from the issue where readiness gates for the spec.strategy.blueGreen.activeService fail to be injected. This means there is a possibility of downtime in the following problematic scenario during an update from V1 to V2: Update is triggered and V2 ReplicaSet stack is scaled up V2 ReplicaSet pods become fully available and ready to be promoted Rollout promotes V2 by updating the label selectors of the active service to point to the V2 stack (from V1) Due to unknown issues (e.g. AWS load balancer controller downtime, AWS rate limiting), registration of the V2 Pod IPs to the TargetGroup does not happen or is delayed. V1 ReplicaSet is scaled down to complete the update After step 5, when the V1 ReplicaSet is scaled down, the outdated TargetGroup would still be pointing to the V1 Pods IPs which no longer exist, causing downtime. To allow for zero-downtime updates, Argo Rollouts has the ability to perform TargetGroup IP verification as an additional safety measure during an update. When this feature is enabled, whenever a service selector modification is made, the Rollout controller blocks progression of the update until it can verify the TargetGroup is accurately targeting the new Pod IPs of the bluegreen.activeService . Verification is achieved by querying AWS APIs to describe the underlying TargetGroup, iterating its registered IPs, and ensuring all Pod IPs of the activeService's Endpoints list are registered in the TargetGroup. Verification must succeed before running postPromotionAnalysis or scaling down the old ReplicaSet. Similarly for the canary strategy, after updating the canary.stableService selector labels to point to the new ReplicaSet, the TargetGroup IP verification feature allows the controller to block the scale down of the old ReplicaSet until it verifies the Pods IP behind the stableService TargetGroup are accurate. TargetGroup Weight Verification \u00b6 Note TargetGroup weight verification available since Argo Rollouts v1.0 TargetGroup weight verification addresses a similar problem to TargetGroup IP verification, but instead of verifying that the Pod IPs of a service are reflected accurately in the TargetGroup, the controller verifies that the traffic weights are accurate from what was set in the ingress annotations. Weight verification is applicable to AWS LoadBalancer controllers which are running either in IP mode or Instance mode. After Argo Rollouts adjusts a canary weight by updating the Ingress annotation, it moves on to the next step. However, due to external factors (e.g. AWS rate limiting, AWS load balancer controller downtime) it is possible that the weight modifications made to the Ingress, did not take effect in the underlying TargetGroup. This is potentially dangerous as the controller will believe it is safe to scale down the old stable stack when in reality, the outdated TargetGroup may still be pointing to it. Using the TargetGroup weight verification feature, the rollout controller will additionally verify the canary weight after a setWeight canary step. It accomplishes this by querying AWS LoadBalancer APIs directly, to confirm that the Rules, Actions, and TargetGroups reflect the desire of Ingress annotation. Usage \u00b6 To enable AWS target group verification, add --aws-verify-target-group flag to the rollout-controller flags: apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : argo-rollouts spec : template : spec : containers : - name : argo-rollouts args : [ --aws-verify-target-group ] # NOTE: in v1.0, the --alb-verify-weight flag should be used instead For this feature to work, the argo-rollouts deployment requires the following AWS API permissions under the Elastic Load Balancing API : { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Action\" : [ \"elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetGroups\" , \"elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers\" , \"elasticloadbalancing:DescribeListeners\" , \"elasticloadbalancing:DescribeRules\" , \"elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTags\" , \"elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetHealth\" ], \"Resource\" : \"*\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" } ] } There are various ways of granting AWS privileges to the argo-rollouts pods, which is highly dependent to your cluster's AWS environment, and out-of-scope of this documentation. Some solutions include: AWS access and secret keys kiam kube2iam EKS ServiceAccount IAM Roles Custom annotations-prefix \u00b6 The AWS Load Balancer Controller allows users to customize the annotation prefix used by the Ingress controller using a flag to the controller, --annotations-prefix (from the default of alb.ingress.kubernetes.io ). If your AWS Load Balancer Controller is customized to use a different annotation prefix, annotationPrefix field should be specified such that the Ingress object will be annotated in a manner understood by the cluster's aws load balancer controller. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout spec : strategy : canary : trafficRouting : alb : annotationPrefix : custom.alb.ingress.kubernetes.io Custom kubernetes.io/ingress.class \u00b6 By default, Argo Rollout will operates on Ingresses with the annotation: apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : alb To configure the controller to operate on Ingresses with different kubernetes.io/ingress.class values, the controller can specify a different value through the --alb-ingress-classes flag in the controller command line arguments. Note that the --alb-ingress-classes flag can be specified multiple times if the Argo Rollouts controller should operate on multiple values. This may be desired when a cluster has multiple Ingress controllers that operate on different kubernetes.io/ingress.class values. If the controller needs to operate on any Ingress without the kubernetes.io/ingress.class annotation, the flag can be specified with an empty string (e.g. --alb-ingress-classes '' ).","title":"AWS ALB"},{"location":"features/traffic-management/alb/#aws-load-balancer-controller-alb","text":"","title":"AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALB)"},{"location":"features/traffic-management/alb/#requirements","text":"AWS Load Balancer Controller v1.1.5 or greater","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"features/traffic-management/alb/#overview","text":"AWS Load Balancer Controller (also known as AWS ALB Ingress Controller) enables traffic management through an Ingress object, which configures an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to one or more Kubernetes services.

This annotation is injected and updated automatically by a Rollout during an update according to the desired traffic weights.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"features/traffic-management/alb/#usage","text":"To configure a Rollout to use the ALB integration and split traffic between the canary and stable services during updates, the Rollout should be configured with the following fields: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout ... spec : strategy : canary : # canaryService and stableService are references to Services which the Rollout will modify # to target the canary ReplicaSet and stable ReplicaSet respectively (required). canaryService : canary-service stableService : stable-service trafficRouting : alb : # The referenced ingress will be injected with a custom action annotation, directing # the AWS Load Balancer Controller to split traffic between the canary and stable # Service, according to the desired traffic weight (required). ingress : ingress # Reference to a Service that the Ingress must target in one of the rules (optional). # If omitted, uses canary.stableService. rootService : root-service # Service port is the port which the Service listens on (required). servicePort : 443 The referenced Ingress should be deployed with an ingress rule that matches the Rollout service: apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : ingress annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : alb spec : rules : - http : paths : - path : /* backend : # serviceName must match either: canary.trafficRouting.alb.rootService (if specified), # or canary.stableService (if rootService is omitted) serviceName : root-service # servicePort must be the value: use-annotation # This instructs AWS Load Balancer Controller to look to annotations on how to direct traffic servicePort : use-annotation During an update, the rollout controller injects the alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.<SERVICE-NAME> annotation, containing a JSON payload understood by the AWS Load Balancer Controller, directing it to split traffic between the canaryService and stableService according to the current canary weight.

When using the AWS LoadBalancer controller in IP mode (e.g. using the AWS CNI), the ALB LoadBalancer targets individual Pod IPs, as opposed to K8s node instances. Targeting Pod IPs comes with an increased risk of downtime during an update, because the Pod IPs behind the underlying AWS TargetGroup can more easily become outdated from the actual availability and status of pods, causing HTTP 502 errors when the TargetGroup points to pods which have already been scaled down. To mitigate this risk, AWS recommends the use of pod readiness gate injection when running the AWS LoadBalancer in IP mode. Readiness gates allow for the AWS LoadBalancer controller to verify that TargetGroups are accurate before marking newly created Pods as \"ready\", preventing premature scale down of the older ReplicaSet. Pod readiness gate injection uses a mutating webhook which decides to inject readiness gates when a pod is created based on the following conditions: * There exists a service matching the pod labels in the same namespace * There exists at least one target group binding that refers to the matching service Another way to describe this is: the AWS LoadBalancer controller injects readiness gates onto Pods only if they are \"reachable\" from an ALB Ingress at the time of pod creation. A pod is considered reachable if an (ALB) Ingress references a Service which matches the pod labels. It ignores all other Pods. One challenge with this manner of pod readiness gate injection, is that modifications to the Service selector labels ( spec.selector ) do not allow for the AWS LoadBalancer controller to inject the readiness gates, because by that time the Pod was already created (and readiness gates are immutable). Note that this is an issue when you change Service selectors of any ALB Service, not just ones involved in Argo Rollouts. Because Argo Rollout's blue-green strategy works by modifying the activeService selector to the new ReplicaSet labels during promotion, it suffers from the issue where readiness gates for the spec.strategy.blueGreen.activeService fail to be injected. This means there is a possibility of downtime in the following problematic scenario during an update from V1 to V2: Update is triggered and V2 ReplicaSet stack is scaled up V2 ReplicaSet pods become fully available and ready to be promoted Rollout promotes V2 by updating the label selectors of the active service to point to the V2 stack (from V1) Due to unknown issues (e.g. AWS load balancer controller downtime, AWS rate limiting), registration of the V2 Pod IPs to the TargetGroup does not happen or is delayed. V1 ReplicaSet is scaled down to complete the update After step 5, when the V1 ReplicaSet is scaled down, the outdated TargetGroup would still be pointing to the V1 Pods IPs which no longer exist, causing downtime. To allow for zero-downtime updates, Argo Rollouts has the ability to perform TargetGroup IP verification as an additional safety measure during an update. When this feature is enabled, whenever a service selector modification is made, the Rollout controller blocks progression of the update until it can verify the TargetGroup is accurately targeting the new Pod IPs of the bluegreen.activeService . Verification is achieved by querying AWS APIs to describe the underlying TargetGroup, iterating its registered IPs, and ensuring all Pod IPs of the activeService's Endpoints list are registered in the TargetGroup. Verification must succeed before running postPromotionAnalysis or scaling down the old ReplicaSet. Similarly for the canary strategy, after updating the canary.stableService selector labels to point to the new ReplicaSet, the TargetGroup IP verification feature allows the controller to block the scale down of the old ReplicaSet until it verifies the Pods IP behind the stableService TargetGroup are accurate.","title":"TargetGroup IP Verification"},{"location":"features/traffic-management/alb/#targetgroup-weight-verification","text":"Note TargetGroup weight verification available since Argo Rollouts v1.0 TargetGroup weight verification addresses a similar problem to TargetGroup IP verification, but instead of verifying that the Pod IPs of a service are reflected accurately in the TargetGroup, the controller verifies that the traffic weights are accurate from what was set in the ingress annotations. Weight verification is applicable to AWS LoadBalancer controllers which are running either in IP mode or Instance mode. After Argo Rollouts adjusts a canary weight by updating the Ingress annotation, it moves on to the next step. However, due to external factors (e.g. AWS rate limiting, AWS load balancer controller downtime) it is possible that the weight modifications made to the Ingress, did not take effect in the underlying TargetGroup. This is potentially dangerous as the controller will believe it is safe to scale down the old stable stack when in reality, the outdated TargetGroup may still be pointing to it. Using the TargetGroup weight verification feature, the rollout controller will additionally verify the canary weight after a setWeight canary step.

Istio offers this functionality through a set of CRDs, and Argo Rollouts automates the management of these resources to provide advanced traffic shaping capabilities to the different versions of the Rollout during an update. How it works \u00b6 Traffic splitting is accomplished in Istio by adjusting traffic weights defined in an Istio VirtualService . When using Argo Rollouts with Istio, a user deploys a VirtualService containing at least one HTTP route containing two HTTP route destinations : a route destination targeting the pods of canary ReplicaSet, and a route destination targeting the pods stable ReplicaSet. Istio provides two approaches for weighted traffic splitting, both approaches are available as options in Argo Rollouts: Host-level traffic splitting Subset-level traffic splitting Host-level Traffic Splitting \u00b6 The first approach to traffic splitting using Argo Rollouts and Istio, is splitting between two hostnames, or Kubernetes Services: a canary Service and a stable Service. This approach is similar to the way all other Argo Rollouts mesh/ingress-controller integrations work (e.g. ALB, SMI, Nginx). Using this approach, the user is required to deploy the following resources: Rollout Service (canary) Service (stable) VirtualService The Rollout should define the following fields: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : rollout-example spec : ... strategy : canary : canaryService : canary-svc # required stableService : stable-svc # required trafficRouting : istio : virtualService : name : rollout-vsvc # required routes : - primary # optional if there is a single route in VirtualService, required otherwise steps : - setWeight : 5 - pause : duration : 10m The VirtualService must contain an HTTP route with a name referenced in the Rollout, containing two route destinations with host values that match the canaryService and stableService referenced in the Rollout. If the VirtualService is defined in a different namespace than the rollout, its name should be rollout-vsvc.<vsvc namespace name> . Note that Istio requires that all weights add to 100, so the initial weights can be 100% to stable, and 0% to canary. apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : VirtualService metadata : name : rollout-vsvc spec : gateways : - istio-rollout-gateway hosts : - istio-rollout.dev.argoproj.io http : - name : primary # referenced in canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualService.routes route : - destination : host : stable-svc # referenced in canary.stableService weight : 100 - destination : host : canary-svc # referenced in canary.canaryService weight : 0 Finally, a canary and stable Service should be deployed. The selector of these Services will be modified by the Rollout during an update to target the canary and stable ReplicaSet pods. Note that if the VirtualService and destination host resides in different namespaces (e.g., VirtualService and Rollout are not in the same namespace), the namespace should be included in the destination host (e.g. stable-svc.<namespace> ). apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : canary-svc spec : ports : - port : 80 targetPort : http protocol : TCP name : http selector : app : rollouts-demo # This selector will be updated with the pod-template-hash of the canary ReplicaSet. e.g.: # rollouts-pod-template-hash: 7bf84f9696 --- apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : stable-svc spec : ports : - port : 80 targetPort : http protocol : TCP name : http selector : app : rollouts-demo # This selector will be updated with the pod-template-hash of the stable ReplicaSet. e.g.: # rollouts-pod-template-hash: 123746c88d During the lifecycle of a Rollout update, Argo Rollouts will continuously: modify the canary Service spec.selector to contain the rollouts-pod-template-hash label of the canary ReplicaSet modify the stable Service spec.selector to contain the rollouts-pod-template-hash label of the stable ReplicaSet modify the VirtualService spec.http[].route[].weight to match the current desired canary weight Note Rollout does not make any other assumptions about the fields within the VirtualService or the Istio mesh. The user could specify additional configurations for the VirtualService like URI rewrite rules on the primary route or any other route if desired. The user can also create specific DestinationRules for each of the services. Subset-level Traffic Splitting \u00b6 Important Available since v1.0 The second approach to traffic splitting using Argo Rollouts and Istio, is splitting between two Istio DestinationRule Subsets : a canary subset and a stable subset. When splitting by DestinationRule subsets, the user is required to deploy the following resources: Rollout Service VirtualService DestinationRule The Rollout should define the following fields: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : rollout-example spec : ... strategy : canary : trafficRouting : istio : virtualService : name : rollout-vsvc # required routes : - primary # optional if there is a single route in VirtualService, required otherwise destinationRule : name : rollout-destrule # required canarySubsetName : canary # required stableSubsetName : stable # required steps : - setWeight : 5 - pause : duration : 10m A single service should be defined, which targets the Rollout pods. Note that unlike the first approach, where traffic splitting is against multiple Services which are modified to contain the rollout-pod-template-hash of the canary/stable ReplicaSets, this Service is not modified by the rollout controller. apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : rollout-example spec : ports : - port : 80 targetPort : http protocol : TCP name : http selector : app : rollout-example The VirtualService must contain an HTTP route with a name referenced in the Rollout, containing two route destinations with subset values that match the canarySubsetName and stableSubsetName referenced in the Rollout.

Link the ClusterRole with the ServiceAccount in the Istio primary cluster. apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : ClusterRoleBinding metadata : name : argo-rollouts-istio-primary roleRef : apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind : ClusterRole name : argo-rollouts-istio-primary subjects : - kind : ServiceAccount name : argo-rollouts-istio-primary namespace : <namespace-of-the-service-account> Now, use the following command to generate a secret for Rollout controller to access the Istio primary cluster. This secret will be applied to the cluster where Argo Rollout is running (i.e, Istio remote cluster), but will be generated from the Istio primary cluster. This secret can be generated right after Step 1, it only requires ServiceAccount to exist. Reference to the command . istioctl x create-remote-secret --type remote --name <cluster-name> \\ --namespace <namespace-of-the-service-account> \\ --service-account <service-account-created-in-step1> \\ --context = \"<ISTIO_PRIMARY_CLUSTER>\" | \\ kubectl apply -f - --context = \"<ARGO_ROLLOUT_CLUSTER/ISTIO_REMOTE_CLUSTER>\" Label the secret. kubectl label secret <istio-remote-secret> istio.argoproj.io/primary-cluster = \"true\" -n <namespace-of-the-secret> Comparison Between Approaches \u00b6 There are some advantages and disadvantages of host-level traffic splitting vs. subset-level traffic splitting. DNS requirements \u00b6 With host-level splitting, the VirtualService requires different host values to split among the two destinations. However, using two host values implies the use of different DNS names (one for the canary, the other for the stable). For north-south traffic, which reaches the Service through the Istio Gateway, having multiple DNS names to reach the canary vs. stable pods may not matter. However, for east-west or intra-cluster traffic, it forces microservice-to-microservice communication to choose whether to hit the stable or the canary DNS name, go through the gateway, or add DNS entries for the VirtualServices. In this situation, the DestinationRule subset traffic splitting would be a better option for intra-cluster canarying. Metrics \u00b6 Depending on the choice of host-level splitting vs. subset-level splitting, there will be different styles of prometheus metrics available. For example, if using host-level splitting, the metrics of the canary vs. stable would appear in the Istio Service metrics dashboard: On the other hand, when splitting via subsets, it would be necessary to query prometheus using different parameters, such as the workload name: Integrating with GitOps \u00b6 Earlier it was explained that VirtualServices should be deployed with an initial canary and stable weight of 0 and 100, respectively, such as in the following example: http : - name : primary route : - destination : host : stable-svc weight : 100 - destination : host : canary-svc weight : 0 This introduces a problem for users practicing GitOps. Since a Rollout will modify these VirtualService weights as the Rollout progresses through its steps, it unfortunately causes the VirtualService to become OutOfSync with the version in git. Additionally, if the VirtualService in git were to be applied while the Rollout is in this state (splitting traffic between the services), the apply would revert the weights back to the values in git (i.e. 100 to stable, 0 to canary). One protection which is implemented in Argo Rollouts, is that it continually watches for changes to managed VirtualServices. In the event that a kubectl apply were to happen using the VirtualService in git, the change would be detected immediately by the rollout controller, and the controller will instantly set the VirtualService weights back to the canary weight appropriate for the given step of the Rollout. But since there is momentary flapping of weights, this behavior should be understood. Some best practices to follow when using Argo CD with Argo Rollouts to prevent this behavior, is to leverage the following Argo CD features: Configure the application to ignore differences in the VirtualService. e.g.: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Application metadata : name : guestbook spec : ignoreDifferences : - group : networking.istio.io kind : VirtualService jsonPointers : - /spec/http/0 Ignoring the differences in the VirtualServices HTTP route, prevents gitops differences in the VirtualService HTTP routes to contribute to the overall sync status of the Argo CD application. This adds the additional benefit of prevent auto-sync operations from being triggered. Configure the Application to only apply OutOfSync resources: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Application metadata : name : guestbook spec : syncPolicy : syncOptions : - ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=true By default, when Argo CD syncs an application, it runs kubectl apply against all resources in git which are part of the application. The ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=true sync option indicates to Argo CD to skip applying resources which it already considers Synced , and only apply the ones which are OutOfSync . This option, when used in conjunction with the ignoreDifferences feature, provides a way to manage the conflict in the desired state of a VirtualService between Argo CD and Argo Rollouts. Argo CD also has an open issue here which would help address this problem. The proposed solution is to introduce an annotation to resources, which indicates to Argo CD to respect and preserve the differences at a specified path, in order to allow other controllers (e.g. Argo Rollouts) controller manage them instead. Alternatives Considered \u00b6 Rollout ownership over the Virtual Service \u00b6 An early design alternative was that instead of the controller modifying a referenced VirtualService, the Rollout controller would create, manage, and own a Virtual Service. While this approach is GitOps friendly, it introduces other issues: To provide the same flexibility as referencing VirtualService within a Rollout, the Rollout needs to inline a large portion of the Istio spec. However, networking is outside the responsibility of the Rollout and makes the Rollout spec unnecessarily complicated. If Istio introduces a feature, that feature will not be available in Argo Rollouts until implemented within Argo Rollouts. Both of these issues adds more complexity to the users and Argo Rollouts developers compared to referencing a Virtual Service. Istio support through the SMI Adapter for Istio \u00b6 SMI is the Service Mesh Interface, which serves as a standard interface for all common features of a service mesh.

This approach is similar to the way all other Argo Rollouts mesh/ingress-controller integrations work (e.g. ALB, SMI, Nginx). Using this approach, the user is required to deploy the following resources: Rollout Service (canary) Service (stable) VirtualService The Rollout should define the following fields: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Rollout metadata : name : rollout-example spec : ... strategy : canary : canaryService : canary-svc # required stableService : stable-svc # required trafficRouting : istio : virtualService : name : rollout-vsvc # required routes : - primary # optional if there is a single route in VirtualService, required otherwise steps : - setWeight : 5 - pause : duration : 10m The VirtualService must contain an HTTP route with a name referenced in the Rollout, containing two route destinations with host values that match the canaryService and stableService referenced in the Rollout. If the VirtualService is defined in a different namespace than the rollout, its name should be rollout-vsvc.<vsvc namespace name> .

The selector of these Services will be modified by the Rollout during an update to target the canary and stable ReplicaSet pods. Note that if the VirtualService and destination host resides in different namespaces (e.g., VirtualService and Rollout are not in the same namespace), the namespace should be included in the destination host (e.g. stable-svc.<namespace> ). apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : canary-svc spec : ports : - port : 80 targetPort : http protocol : TCP name : http selector : app : rollouts-demo # This selector will be updated with the pod-template-hash of the canary ReplicaSet. e.g.: # rollouts-pod-template-hash: 7bf84f9696 --- apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : name : stable-svc spec : ports : - port : 80 targetPort : http protocol : TCP name : http selector : app : rollouts-demo # This selector will be updated with the pod-template-hash of the stable ReplicaSet. e.g.: # rollouts-pod-template-hash: 123746c88d During the lifecycle of a Rollout update, Argo Rollouts will continuously: modify the canary Service spec.selector to contain the rollouts-pod-template-hash label of the canary ReplicaSet modify the stable Service spec.selector to contain the rollouts-pod-template-hash label of the stable ReplicaSet modify the VirtualService spec.http[].route[].weight to match the current desired canary weight Note Rollout does not make any other assumptions about the fields within the VirtualService or the Istio mesh.

Since a Rollout will modify these VirtualService weights as the Rollout progresses through its steps, it unfortunately causes the VirtualService to become OutOfSync with the version in git. Additionally, if the VirtualService in git were to be applied while the Rollout is in this state (splitting traffic between the services), the apply would revert the weights back to the values in git (i.e. 100 to stable, 0 to canary). One protection which is implemented in Argo Rollouts, is that it continually watches for changes to managed VirtualServices. In the event that a kubectl apply were to happen using the VirtualService in git, the change would be detected immediately by the rollout controller, and the controller will instantly set the VirtualService weights back to the canary weight appropriate for the given step of the Rollout. But since there is momentary flapping of weights, this behavior should be understood. Some best practices to follow when using Argo CD with Argo Rollouts to prevent this behavior, is to leverage the following Argo CD features: Configure the application to ignore differences in the VirtualService. e.g.: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Application metadata : name : guestbook spec : ignoreDifferences : - group : networking.istio.io kind : VirtualService jsonPointers : - /spec/http/0 Ignoring the differences in the VirtualServices HTTP route, prevents gitops differences in the VirtualService HTTP routes to contribute to the overall sync status of the Argo CD application. This adds the additional benefit of prevent auto-sync operations from being triggered. Configure the Application to only apply OutOfSync resources: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Application metadata : name : guestbook spec : syncPolicy : syncOptions : - ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=true By default, when Argo CD syncs an application, it runs kubectl apply against all resources in git which are part of the application. The ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=true sync option indicates to Argo CD to skip applying resources which it already considers Synced , and only apply the ones which are OutOfSync . This option, when used in conjunction with the ignoreDifferences feature, provides a way to manage the conflict in the desired state of a VirtualService between Argo CD and Argo Rollouts. Argo CD also has an open issue here which would help address this problem. The proposed solution is to introduce an annotation to resources, which indicates to Argo CD to respect and preserve the differences at a specified path, in order to allow other controllers (e.g. Argo Rollouts) controller manage them instead.","title":"Integrating with GitOps"},{"location":"features/traffic-management/istio/#alternatives-considered","text":"","title":"Alternatives Considered"},{"location":"features/traffic-management/istio/#rollout-ownership-over-the-virtual-service","text":"An early design alternative was that instead of the controller modifying a referenced VirtualService, the Rollout controller would create, manage, and own a Virtual Service.

In this example, those Services are named: rollouts-demo-stable and rollouts-demo-canary respectively. Run the following commands to deploy: A Rollout Three Services (root, stable, canary) An Ingress kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/alb/rollout.yaml kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/alb/services.yaml kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/alb/ingress.yaml After applying the manifests you should see the following rollout, services, and ingress resources in the cluster: $ kubectl get ro NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE rollouts-demo 1 1 1 1 $ kubectl get svc NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT ( S ) AGE rollouts-demo-root NodePort 10 .100.16.123 <none> 80 :30225/TCP 2m43s rollouts-demo-canary NodePort 10 .100.16.64 <none> 80 :30224/TCP 2m43s rollouts-demo-stable NodePort 10 .100.146.232 <none> 80 :31135/TCP 2m43s $ kubectl get ingress NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE rollouts-demo-ingress * b0548428-default-rolloutsd-6951-1972570952.ap-northeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com 80 6m36s kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo 2.

To understand how this works, inspect the listener rules for the ALB. When looking at the listener rules, we see that the forward action weights have been modified by the controller to reflect the current weight of the canary. The controller has added rollouts-pod-template-hash selector to the Services and attached the same label to the Pods. Therefore, you can split the traffic by simply forwarding the requests to the Services according to the weights. As the Rollout progresses through steps, the forward action weights will be adjusted to match the current setWeight of the steps.","title":"AWS ALB"},{"location":"getting-started/alb/#getting-started-aws-load-balancer-controller","text":"This guide covers how Argo Rollouts integrates with the AWS Load Balancer Controller for traffic shaping.

To understand how this works, inspect the listener rules for the ALB. When looking at the listener rules, we see that the forward action weights have been modified by the controller to reflect the current weight of the canary. The controller has added rollouts-pod-template-hash selector to the Services and attached the same label to the Pods. Therefore, you can split the traffic by simply forwarding the requests to the Services according to the weights. As the Rollout progresses through steps, the forward action weights will be adjusted to match the current setWeight of the steps.","title":"2.

All files used in this guide are available in the examples directory of this repository. Requirements \u00b6 Kubernetes cluster Argo-Rollouts installed in the cluster Note If using Ambassador Edge Stack or Emissary-ingress 2.0+, you will need to install Argo-Rollouts version v1.1+, and you will need to supply --ambassador-api-version x.getambassador.io/v3alpha1 to your argo-rollouts deployment. 1. Install and configure Ambassador Edge Stack \u00b6 If you don't have Ambassador in your cluster you can install it following the Edge Stack documentation . By default, Edge Stack routes via Kubernetes services. For best performance with canaries, we recommend you use endpoint routing. Enable endpoint routing on your cluster by saving the following configuration in a file called resolver.yaml : apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2 kind: KubernetesEndpointResolver metadata: name: endpoint Apply this configuration to your cluster: kubectl apply -f resolver.yaml . 2. Create the Kubernetes Services \u00b6 We'll create two Kubernetes services, named echo-stable and echo-canary . Save this configuration to the file echo-service.yaml . apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: labels: app: echo name: echo-stable spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: http port: 80 protocol: TCP targetPort: 8080 selector: app: echo --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: labels: app: echo name: echo-canary spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: http port: 80 protocol: TCP targetPort: 8080 selector: app: echo We'll also create an Edge Stack route to the services.

Deploy the Echo Service \u00b6 Create a Rollout resource and save it to a file called rollout.yaml . Note the trafficRouting attribute, which tells Argo to use Ambassador Edge Stack for routing. apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind: Rollout metadata: name: echo-rollout spec: selector: matchLabels: app: echo template: metadata: labels: app: echo spec: containers: - image: hashicorp/http-echo args: - \"-text=VERSION 1\" - -listen=:8080 imagePullPolicy: Always name: echo-v1 ports: - containerPort: 8080 strategy: canary: stableService: echo-stable canaryService: echo-canary trafficRouting: ambassador: mappings: - echo steps: - setWeight: 30 - pause: {duration: 30s} - setWeight: 60 - pause: {duration: 30s} - setWeight: 100 - pause: {duration: 10} Apply the rollout to your cluster kubectl apply -f rollout.yaml . Note that no canary rollout will occur, as this is the first version of the service being deployed. 4. Test the service \u00b6 We'll now test that this rollout works as expected. Open a new terminal window. We'll use it to send requests to the cluster. Get the external IP address for Edge Stack: export AMBASSADOR_LB_ENDPOINT=$(kubectl -n ambassador get svc ambassador -o \"go-template={{range .status.loadBalancer.ingress}}{{or .ip .hostname}}{{end}}\") Send a request to the echo service: curl -Lk \"https://$AMBASSADOR_LB_ENDPOINT/echo/\" You should get a response of \"VERSION 1\". 5. Rollout a new version \u00b6 It's time to rollout a new version of the service. Update the echo container in the rollout.yaml to display \"VERSION 2\": apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind: Rollout metadata: name: echo-rollout spec: selector: matchLabels: app: echo template: metadata: labels: app: echo spec: containers: - image: hashicorp/http-echo args: - \"-text=VERSION 2\" - -listen=:8080 imagePullPolicy: Always name: echo-v1 ports: - containerPort: 8080 strategy: canary: stableService: echo-stable canaryService: echo-canary trafficRouting: ambassador: mappings: - echo steps: - setWeight: 30 - pause: {duration: 30s} - setWeight: 60 - pause: {duration: 30s} - setWeight: 100 - pause: {duration: 10} Apply the rollout to the cluster by typing kubectl apply -f rollout.yaml . This will rollout a version 2 of the service by routing 30% of traffic to the service for 30 seconds, followed by 60% of traffic for another 30 seconds.

The VirtualService and route referenced in either trafficRouting.istio.virtualService or trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices . trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices helps in adding one or more virtualServices unlike trafficRouting.istio.virtualService where only single virtualService can be added. This is required to have either HTTP or TLS, or both route specs that splits between the stable and the canary services referenced in the rollout. If the route is HTTPS/TLS, we can match it based on the given port number and/or SNI hosts. Note that both of them are optional and only needed if you want to match any rule in your VirtualService which contains these. In this guide, the two services are: rollouts-demo-stable and rollouts-demo-canary respectively. The weights for these two services should initially be set to 100% on the stable service and 0% on the canary service. During an update, these values will get modified by the controller. If there are multiple VirtualService then weight values for stable and canary service of each VirtualService will be modified by the controller simultaneously. Note that since we have both the HTTP and HTTPS routes in our rollout spec and they match the VirtualService specs, weights will get modified for both these routes. apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : VirtualService metadata : name : rollouts-demo-vsvc1 spec : gateways : - rollouts-demo-gateway hosts : - rollouts-demo-vsvc1.local http : - name : http-primary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.routes route : - destination : host : rollouts-demo-stable # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.stableService port : number : 15372 weight : 100 - destination : host : rollouts-demo-canary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.canaryService port : number : 15372 weight : 0 tls : - match : - port : 443 # Should match the port number of the route defined in rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.tlsRoutes sniHosts : # Should match all the SNI hosts of the route defined in rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.tlsRoutes - reviews.bookinfo.com - localhost route : - destination : host : rollouts-demo-stable # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.stableService weight : 100 - destination : host : rollouts-demo-canary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.canaryService weight : 0 apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : VirtualService metadata : name : rollouts-demo-vsvc2 spec : gateways : - rollouts-demo-gateway hosts : - rollouts-demo-vsvc2.local http : - name : http-secondary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.routes route : - destination : host : rollouts-demo-stable # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.stableService port : number : 15373 weight : 100 - destination : host : rollouts-demo-canary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.canaryService port : number : 15373 weight : 0 tls : - match : - port : 443 # Should match the port number of the route defined in rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.tlsRoutes sniHosts : # Should match all the SNI hosts of the route defined in rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.tlsRoutes - reviews.bookinfo.com route : - destination : host : rollouts-demo-stable # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.stableService weight : 100 - destination : host : rollouts-demo-canary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.canaryService weight : 0 Run the following commands to deploy: A Rollout Two Services (stable and canary) One or more Istio VirtualServices An Istio Gateway kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/rollout.yaml kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/services.yaml kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/multipleVirtualsvc.yaml kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/gateway.yaml After applying the manifests you should see the following rollout, services, virtualservices, and gateway resources in the cluster: $ kubectl get ro NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE rollouts-demo 1 1 1 1 $ kubectl get svc NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT ( S ) AGE rollouts-demo-canary ClusterIP 10 .103.146.137 <none> 80 /TCP 37s rollouts-demo-stable ClusterIP 10 .101.158.227 <none> 80 /TCP 37s $ kubectl get virtualservice NAME GATEWAYS HOSTS AGE rollouts-demo-vsvc1 [ rollouts-demo-gateway ] [ rollouts-demo-vsvc1.local ] 54s rollouts-demo-vsvc2 [ rollouts-demo-gateway ] [ rollouts-demo-vsvc2.local ] 54s $ kubectl get gateway NAME AGE rollouts-demo-gateway 71s kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo 2.

The weights for these two services should initially be set to 100% on the stable service and 0% on the canary service. During an update, these values will get modified by the controller. If there are multiple VirtualService then weight values for stable and canary service of each VirtualService will be modified by the controller simultaneously. Note that since we have both the HTTP and HTTPS routes in our rollout spec and they match the VirtualService specs, weights will get modified for both these routes. apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : VirtualService metadata : name : rollouts-demo-vsvc1 spec : gateways : - rollouts-demo-gateway hosts : - rollouts-demo-vsvc1.local http : - name : http-primary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.routes route : - destination : host : rollouts-demo-stable # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.stableService port : number : 15372 weight : 100 - destination : host : rollouts-demo-canary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.canaryService port : number : 15372 weight : 0 tls : - match : - port : 443 # Should match the port number of the route defined in rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.tlsRoutes sniHosts : # Should match all the SNI hosts of the route defined in rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.tlsRoutes - reviews.bookinfo.com - localhost route : - destination : host : rollouts-demo-stable # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.stableService weight : 100 - destination : host : rollouts-demo-canary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.canaryService weight : 0 apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : VirtualService metadata : name : rollouts-demo-vsvc2 spec : gateways : - rollouts-demo-gateway hosts : - rollouts-demo-vsvc2.local http : - name : http-secondary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.routes route : - destination : host : rollouts-demo-stable # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.stableService port : number : 15373 weight : 100 - destination : host : rollouts-demo-canary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.canaryService port : number : 15373 weight : 0 tls : - match : - port : 443 # Should match the port number of the route defined in rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.tlsRoutes sniHosts : # Should match all the SNI hosts of the route defined in rollout.spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualServices.tlsRoutes - reviews.bookinfo.com route : - destination : host : rollouts-demo-stable # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.stableService weight : 100 - destination : host : rollouts-demo-canary # Should match rollout.spec.strategy.canary.canaryService weight : 0 Run the following commands to deploy: A Rollout Two Services (stable and canary) One or more Istio VirtualServices An Istio Gateway kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/rollout.yaml kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/services.yaml kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/multipleVirtualsvc.yaml kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/gateway.yaml After applying the manifests you should see the following rollout, services, virtualservices, and gateway resources in the cluster: $ kubectl get ro NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE rollouts-demo 1 1 1 1 $ kubectl get svc NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT ( S ) AGE rollouts-demo-canary ClusterIP 10 .103.146.137 <none> 80 /TCP 37s rollouts-demo-stable ClusterIP 10 .101.158.227 <none> 80 /TCP 37s $ kubectl get virtualservice NAME GATEWAYS HOSTS AGE rollouts-demo-vsvc1 [ rollouts-demo-gateway ] [ rollouts-demo-vsvc1.local ] 54s rollouts-demo-vsvc2 [ rollouts-demo-gateway ] [ rollouts-demo-vsvc2.local ] 54s $ kubectl get gateway NAME AGE rollouts-demo-gateway 71s kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo","title":"1.

One convenient way to reach the gateway using minikube, is using the minikube tunnel command, which assigns Services a LoadBalancer. This command should be run in the background, usually in a separate terminal window: minikube tunnel While running minikube tunnel , the istio-ingressgateway Service will now have an external IP which can be retrieved via kubectl : $ kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT ( S ) AGE istio-ingressgateway LoadBalancer 10 .100.136.45 10 .100.136.45 15020 :31711/TCP,80:31298/TCP.... 7d22h The LoadBalancer external IP (10.100.136.45 in this example) is now reachable to access services in the Istio mesh. Istio routes requests to the correct pod based on the Host HTTP header. Follow the guide on supplying host headers to learn how to configure your client environment to supply the proper request to reach the pod. Linkerd Setup \u00b6 Linkerd can be installed using the linkerd CLI. brew install linkerd linkerd install | kubectl apply -f - Linkerd does not provide its own ingress controller, choosing instead to work alongside your ingress controller of choice. On minikube, we can use the built-in NGINX ingress addon and reconfigure it to be part of the linkerd mesh. # Install the NGINX ingress controller addon minikube addons enable ingress # Patch the nginx-ingress-controller deployment to allow injection of the linkerd proxy to the # pod, so that it will be part of the mesh. kubectl patch deploy ingress-nginx-controller -n kube-system \\ -p '{\"spec\":{\"template\":{\"metadata\":{\"annotations\":{\"linkerd.io/inject\":\"enabled\"}}}}}' Supplying Host Headers \u00b6 Most ingress controllers and service mesh implementations rely on the Host HTTP request header being supplied in the request in order to determine how to route the request to the correct pod. Determining the hostname to IP mapping \u00b6 For the Host header to be set in the request, the hostname of the service should resolve to the public IP address of the ingress or service mesh. Depending on if you are using an ingress controller or a service mesh, use one of the following techniques to determine the correct hostname to IP mapping: Ingresses \u00b6 For traffic which is reaching the cluster network via a normal Kubernetes Ingress, the hostname should map to the IP of the ingress. We can retrieve the external IP of the ingress from the Ingress object itself, using kubectl : $ kubectl get ing rollouts-demo-stable NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE rollouts-demo-stable <none> rollouts-demo.local 192 .168.64.2 80 80m In the example above, the hostname rollouts-demo.local should be configured to resolve to the IP 192.168.64.2 . The next section describes various ways to configure your local system to resolve the hostname to the desired IP. Istio \u00b6 In the case of Istio, traffic enters the mesh through an Ingress Gateway , which simply is a load balancer sitting at the edge of mesh. To determine the correct hostname to IP mapping, it largely depends on what was configured in the VirtualService and Gateway . If you are following the Istio getting started guide , the examples use the \"default\" istio ingress gateway, which we can obtain from kubectl: $ kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT ( S ) AGE istio-ingressgateway LoadBalancer 10 .100.136.45 10 .100.136.45 15020 :31711/TCP,80:31298/TCP.... 7d22h In the above example, the hostname rollouts-demo.local should be configured to resolve to the IP 10.100.136.45 . The next section describes various ways to configure your local system to resolve the hostname to the desired IP. Configuring local hostname resolution \u00b6 Now that you have determined the correct hostname to IP mapping, the next step involves configuring the system so that will resolve properly. There are different techniques to do this: DNS Entry \u00b6 In real, production environments, the Host header is typically achieved by adding a DNS entry for the hostname in the DNS server. However, for local development, this is typically not an easily accessible option. /etc/hosts Entry \u00b6 On local workstations, a local entry to /etc/hosts can be added to map the hostname and IP address of the ingress. For example, the following is an example of an /etc/hosts file which maps rollouts-demo.local to IP 10.100.136.45 . ## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting. Do not change this entry. ## 127 .0.0.1 localhost 255 .255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1 localhost 10 .100.136.45 rollouts-demo.local The advantages of using a host entry, are that it works for all clients (CLIs, browsers). On the other hand, it is harder to maintain if the IP address changes frequently. Supply Header in Curl \u00b6 Clients such as curl, have the ability to explicitly set a header (the -H flag in curl). For example: $ curl -I -H 'Host: rollouts-demo.local' http://10.100.136.45/color HTTP/1.1 200 OK content-type: text/plain ; charset = utf-8 x-content-type-options: nosniff date: Wed, 24 Jun 2020 08 :44:59 GMT content-length: 6 x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1 server: istio-envoy Notice that the same request made without the header, fails with a 404 Not Found error. $ curl -I http://10.100.136.45/color HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found date: Wed, 24 Jun 2020 08 :46:07 GMT server: istio-envoy transfer-encoding: chunked Browser Extension \u00b6 Similar to curl's ability to explicitly set a header, browsers can also achieve this via browser extensions. One example of a browser extension which can do this, is ModHeader .","title":"Environment Setup"},{"location":"getting-started/setup/#environment-set-up","text":"This guide shows how to set up a local environment for development, testing, learning, or demoing purposes.","title":"Environment Set Up"},{"location":"getting-started/setup/#helm","text":"Some dependencies are installable via the Helm stable repository: helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts helm repo update","title":"Helm"},{"location":"getting-started/setup/#minikube","text":"","title":"Minikube"},{"location":"getting-started/setup/#nginx-ingress-controller-setup","text":"The following instructions describe how to configure NGINX Ingress Controller on minikube.
