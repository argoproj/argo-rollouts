# Rollout Specification

The following describes all the available fields of a rollout:

```yaml

kind: Rollout
metadata:

spec:
  # Number of desired pods.
  # Defaults to 1.
  replicas: 5
  analysis:
    # limits the number of successful analysis runs and experiments to be stored in a history
    # Defaults to 5.
    successfulRunHistoryLimit: 10
    # limits the number of unsuccessful analysis runs and experiments to be stored in a history. 
    # Stages for unsuccessful: "Error", "Failed", "Inconclusive"
    # Defaults to 5.
    unsuccessfulRunHistoryLimit: 10

  # Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by
  # this will be the ones affected by this rollout. It must match the pod
  # template's labels.
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: guestbook

  # WorkloadRef holds a references to a workload that provides Pod template 
  # (e.g. Deployment). If used, then do not use Rollout template property.
  workloadRef: 
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment

  # Pause allows a user to manually pause a rollout at any time. A rollout
  # will not advance through its steps while it is manually paused, but HPA
  # auto-scaling will still occur. Typically not explicitly set the manifest,
  # but controlled via tools (e.g. kubectl argo rollouts pause). If true at
  # initial creation of Rollout, replicas are not scaled up automatically
  # from zero unless manually promoted.
  paused: true

  # The maximum time in seconds in which a rollout must make progress during
  # an update, before it is considered to be failed. Argo Rollouts will
  # continue to process failed rollouts and a condition with a

  # Note that progress will not be estimated during the time a rollout is
  # paused.
