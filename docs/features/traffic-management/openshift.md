# Openshift Routes

[Openshift Routes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/networking/routes/route-configuration.html) allow services to be exposed through externally-reachable hostnames. Openshift routes have additional functionality with traffic splitting between different services, allowing Argo Rollouts to shift traffic between different versions during a Canary deployment.

## How it works

Canary deployment is achieved by configuring the weight amounts to different backends on the Openshift route resource:

```yaml
kind: Route
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: main-route
spec:
  host: https://main-route.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: stable-service
    weight: 80
  alternateBackends:
    - kind: Service
      name: canary-service
      weight: 20
  port:
    targetPort: http
  wildcardPolicy: None
```

In this example, the route is sending 80% of the traffic on the route URL to the service `stable-service` and the remaining 20% to `canary-service`. Changing the weight fields of either the default backend (under `to`) or the canary backend (under `alternateBackends`) will result in the corresponding traffic shift. Of course, Argo Rollouts will automate the update of the weight values, given that at least one route resource exists and is specified within the rollout:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
...
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      stableService: stable-service
      canaryService: canary-service
      trafficRouting:
        openshift:
          routes:
            - main-route # Required
      steps:
      - setWeight: 30
      - pause: {duration: 60s}
      - setWeight: 60
      - pause: {duration: 60s}
      ...
```

Multiple routes are supported as long as each of their default backends points to the `stableService` defined in the rollout.

The Argo Rollouts controller will:
 1. Create the `alternateBackends` field in each route, pointing to the `canaryService`
 2. Update both the default and alternate backend weights
 3. Delete the `alternateBackends` field once the controller finishes
