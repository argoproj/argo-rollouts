  # The maximum time in seconds for a rollout to make progress before it is considered to be failed. Argo Rollouts will continue to process failed rollouts and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded reason will be surfaced in the rollout status. Note that progress will not be estimated during the time a rollout is paused. Defaults to 600s.

      # automatically promotes the current ReplicaSet to active after the specified pause delay in seconds after the ReplicaSet becomes ready. If omitted, the Rollout enters and remains in a paused state until manually resumed by resetting spec.Paused to false. +optional

      # adds a delay before scaling down the previous replicaset. If omitted, the Rollout waits 30 seconds before scaling down the previous ReplicaSet. A minimum of 30 seconds is recommended to ensure IP table propagation across the nodes in a cluster.

    canary:
      # CanaryService holds the name of a service which selects pods with canary version and don't select any pods with stable version. +optional
      canaryService: canary-service
      # The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total pods at the start of update (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down. This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0. By default, a fixed value of 1 is used. Example: when this is set to 30%, the old RC can be scaled down by 30% immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old RC can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new RC, ensuring that at least 70% of original number of pods are available at all times during the update. +optional
      maxUnavailable: 1
      # The maximum number of pods that can be scheduled above the original number of pods. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. By default, a value of 1 is used. Example: when this is set to 30%, the new RC can be scaled up by 30% immediately when the rolling update starts. Once old pods have been killed, new RC can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of pods running at any time during the update is atmost 130% of original pods. +optional
