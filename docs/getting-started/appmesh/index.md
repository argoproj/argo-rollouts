# Getting Started - App Mesh

This guide covers how Argo Rollouts integrates with service-meshes managed by [AWS App Mesh](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/what-is-app-mesh.html). This guide builds upon the concepts of the [basic getting started guide](../../getting-started.md).

## Requirements
- Kubernetes cluster with AWS App Mesh Controller for K8s installed

!!! tip

    See the [App Mesh Controler Installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/getting-started-kubernetes.html) on how to get started using App Mesh with Kubernetes.

## 1. Deploy the Rollout, Services, App Mesh CRD

When App Mesh is used as the traffic router, the Rollout canary strategy must define the following mandatory fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: my-rollout
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      # canaryService and stableService are references to Services which the Rollout will modify
      # to target the canary ReplicaSet and stable ReplicaSet respectively (required).
      canaryService: my-svc-canary
      stableService: my-svc-stable
      trafficRouting:
        appMesh:
          # The referenced virtual-service will be used to determine the virtual-router that is
          # manipulated to update canary weights.
          virtualService:
            # name of the virtual-service App Mesh CR
            name: my-svc
            # Optional set of routes to update. If empty, all routes associated with the virtual-service are updated.
            routes:
            - http-primary
          # virtualNodeGroup is a structure to refer App Mesh virtual-node CR corresponding to Canary and Stable versions
          virtualNodeGroup:
            # canaryVirtualNodeRef refers to virtual-node corresponding to canary version. Rollouts controller will
            # update the podSelector of this virtual-node to latest canary pod-hash generated by controller.
            canaryVirtualNodeRef:
              name: my-vn-canary
            # stableVirtualNodeRef refers to virtual-node corresponding to stable version. Rollouts controller will
            # update the podSelector of this virtual-node to latest stable pod-hash generated by controller.
            stableVirtualNodeRef:
              name: my-vn-stable
      steps:
      - setWeight: 25
      - pause: {}
      ...
```

In this guide, the two services are: `my-svc-canary` and `my-svc-stable` respectively. There are two
virtual-node CRs corresponding to these services named `my-vn-canary` and `my-vn-stable`
respectively. In addition, there is a virtual-service named `rollout-demo-vsvc` that is provided by a
virtual-router CR named `rollout-demo-vrouter`. This virtual-router need have at least one route with action to forward
traffic to the canary and stable virtual-nodes. Initially weight for canary is set to 0% while for stable it is 100%.
During rollout, controller will modify the weights on route(s) based on the configuraiton defined in
`steps[N].setWeight`.

The canary and stable services are configured to be headless. This is necessary to allow App Mesh to properly handle
conneciton pooling as pods are reassigned from canary to stable.

To summarize, run the following commands to deploy a service:

* Two services (stable and canary)
* One service (for VIP and DNS lookup)
* Two App Mesh virtual-nodes (stable and canary)
* One App Mesh virtual-router with routes to virtual-nodes
* One App Mesh virtual-service corresponding to VIP service
* A rollout

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/examples/appmesh/canary-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/examples/appmesh/canary-rollout.yaml
```
## 2. Verify service

First make sure that rollout is stable.

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout my-rollout -n argo-examples -w
```

Then make sure the service is functional.

```shell
kubectl -n argo-examples port-forward svc/my-svc 8181:80
```

## 3. Rollout new version

Now its time to deploy new version. Update the rollout with new image.

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts set image my-rollout demo=argoproj/rollouts-demo:green -n argo-examples
```

Rollout should deploy a new canary revision and update the weights under virtual-router.

```shell
kubectl get -n argo-examples virtualrouter my-vrouter -o json | jq ".spec.routes[0].httpRoute.action.weightedTargets"
[
  {
    "virtualNodeRef": {
      "name": "my-vn-canary"
    },
    "weight": 25
  },
  {
    "virtualNodeRef": {
      "name": "my-vn-stable"
    },
    "weight": 75
  }
]
```

Now manually approve the rollout that is paused indefinitely, and continue watching the routes get updated

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts promote my-rollout -n argo-examples

watch -d 'kubectl get -n argo-examples virtualrouter my-vrouter -o json | jq ".spec.routes[0].httpRoute.action.weightedTargets"'
```
