# Getting Started - Istio

This guide covers how Argo Rollouts integrates with the [Istio Service Mesh](https://istio.io/) 
for traffic shaping. 
This guide builds upon the concepts of the [basic getting started guide](../../getting-started.md).

## Requirements
- Kubernetes cluster with Istio installed

!!! tip
    See the [environment setup guide for Istio](../setup/index.md#istio-setup) on how to setup a
    local minikube environment with Istio

## 1. Deploy the Rollout, Services, Istio VirtualService, and Istio Gateway

When Istio is used as the traffic router, the Rollout canary strategy must define the following
mandatory fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: rollouts-demo
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      # Reference to a Service which the controller updates to point to the canary ReplicaSet
      canaryService: rollouts-demo-canary
      # Reference to a Service which the controller updates to point to the stable ReplicaSet
      stableService: rollouts-demo-stable
      trafficRouting:
        istio:
          virtualService:
            # Reference to a VirtualService which the controller updates with canary weights
            name: rollouts-demo-vsvc
            routes:
            - primary # At least one route is required
...
```

The VirtualService and route referenced in `trafficRouting.istio.virtualService` is required
to have a HTTP route which splits between the stable and canary Services, referenced in the rollout.
In this guide, those Services are named: `rollouts-demo-stable` and `rollouts-demo-canary` 
respectively. The weight values for these services used should be initially set to 100% stable, 
and 0% on the canary. During an update, these values will be modified by the controller.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: rollouts-demo-vsvc
spec:
  gateways:
  - rollouts-demo-gateway
  hosts:
  - rollouts-demo.local
  http:
  - name: primary  # Should match spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.istio.virtualService.routes
    route:
    - destination:
        host: rollouts-demo-stable  # Should match spec.strategy.canary.stableService
      weight: 100
    - destination:
        host: rollouts-demo-canary  # Should match spec.strategy.canary.canaryService
      weight: 0

```

Run the following commands to deploy:

* A Rollout
* Two Services (stable and canary)
* An Istio VirtualService
* An Istio Gateway

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/rollout.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/services.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/virtualsvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/master/docs/getting-started/istio/gateway.yaml
```

After applying the manifests you should see the following rollout, services, virtualservices, 
and gateway resources in the cluster:

```shell
$ kubectl get ro
NAME            DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE
rollouts-demo   1         1         1            1

$ kubectl get svc
NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
rollouts-demo-canary   ClusterIP   10.103.146.137   <none>        80/TCP    37s
rollouts-demo-stable   ClusterIP   10.101.158.227   <none>        80/TCP    37s

$ kubectl get virtualservice
NAME                 GATEWAYS                  HOSTS                   AGE
rollouts-demo-vsvc   [rollouts-demo-gateway]   [rollouts-demo.local]   54s

$ kubectl get gateway
NAME                    AGE
rollouts-demo-gateway   71s
```

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo
```

## 2. Perform an update

Update the rollout by changing the image, and wait for it to reached the paused state.

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo rollouts-demo=argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo
```

At this point, both the canary and stable version of the Rollout are running, with 5% of the
traffic directed to the canary. To understand how this works, inspect the VirtualService which
the Rollout was referencing. When looking at the VirtualService, we see that the route destination
weights have been modified by the controller to reflect the current weight of the canary.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: rollouts-demo-vsvc
  namespace: default
spec:
  gateways:
  - rollouts-demo-gateway
  hosts:
  - rollouts-demo.local
  http:
  - name: primary
    route:
    - destination:
        host: rollouts-demo-stable
      weight: 95
    - destination:
        host: rollouts-demo-canary
      weight: 5
```

As the Rollout progresses through steps, the HTTP route destination weights will be adjusted to
match the current setWeight of the steps.
